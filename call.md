### Our Call for Speakers has closed.

#### If you have submitted a talk, we will notify you of the result shortly.

Women Techmakers Vienna is an event that envisions empowering women
to pursue careers in the STEM fields; these encompass science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics.
Women Techmakers Vienna focuses on raising the public awareness through the
power of example of existing gender issues and possible solutions.

We are in search of engaging speakers and workshop facilitators that can
provide interesting technical or social-aspect talks and workshops,
highlighting their experiences.

Your _talk_ needs to be in **English** and you will have a time slot of
**30 minutes**. There will be no Q&A session.

Your _workshop_ needs to be in **English** and you will have a time slot of
**60, 90 or 120 minutes.**

 * _Technical talks_ should be about a subject that belongs to the STEM fields,
 presented in a fun and introductory manner since the attendees might lack
 the speaker's fundamental knowledge on the subject.
 They should highlight your personal achievement and success story,
 more than the technical aspects.
 * _Social-aspect talks_ should demonstrate causes, examples, solutions for
 gender issues and be empowering young (and not only) women that pursue,
 or plan to pursue a career in STEM.
 * _Workshops_ can either be empowering for solutions relevant to gender issues,
 or hands-on workshops for STEM related topics.

In order to be selected, we require a short introduction about yourself
and a draft outline of your talk.

Please send in your proposal until *24 December 2017*.
All proposals will be carefully reviewed by the Women Techmakers team and
you will be contacted if selected for our event.

We are here for you!
Feel free to contact us for further information or if you need any support
with preparing your talk proposal.
