Do you see yourself as a role model or would like to be one? 

Women Techmakers Vienna is an event that envisions empowering women to pursue careers in the STEM fields; these encompass science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Women Techmakers Vienna focuses on raising the public awareness through the power of example of existing gender issues and possible solutions.

We are in search of engaging and respected speakers that can provide interesting technical or social-aspect talks and their experiences.

During the one day event we are searching for 5 selected speakers. Would you be interested in embodying our vision with a talk? 

Your talk needs to be in **English** and you will have a time slot of **30-40 minutes** including a 10 minutes question and answer session after the talk.

- Technical talks should be about a subject that belongs to the STEM fields, presented in a fun and introductory manner since the attendees might lack the speaker's fundamental knowledge on the subject. 
- Social-aspect talks should demonstrate causes, examples, solutions for gender issues and be empowering young (and not only) women that pursue, or plan to pursue a career in STEM.

In order to be selected, we require a short introduction about yourself and a draft outline of your talk.

Please send in your talk proposal until **7th of February 2016**. All talk proposals will be carefully reviewed by the Women Techmakers team and you will be contacted if selected as a speaker for our event.

We are here for you! Feel free to contact us for further information or if you need any support with creating your talk proposal.
