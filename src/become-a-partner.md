    <h1>Become a Partner</h1>
    <p>
      At Women Techmakers Vienna, we believe in long-term collaboration to create meaningful impact. That’s why we invite companies and organizations to join us as <b>partners</b> — supporting our community throughout the year and enabling us to run events and initiatives beyond our annual conference.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Partner With Us?</h2>
    <p>
      As a partner, you help us build a sustainable foundation for our work. Your support makes it possible to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Provide Space:</b> Offer your venue to host our meetups, workshops, or networking events.</li>
      <li><b>Support Year-Round:</b> Contribute financially to cover essential fixed costs such as website hosting, design, and communication tools.</li>
      <li><b>Stay Connected:</b> Be part of our ongoing activities and connect with our community more than once a year.</li>
      <li><b>Shape the Future:</b> Collaborate with us on new ideas and initiatives that empower women and people with disabilities in technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By becoming a partner, you’re not just supporting one event — you’re helping to keep our community alive and thriving all year long. Together, we can create lasting opportunities for inclusion, growth, and innovation in tech.
