<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Women Techmakers Vienna community or attendee of one of the Women Techmakers Vienna events, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the RESPONSE TEAM immediately. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>In order to protect attendees and members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Women Techmakers members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

You can report violations in the following ways:

<p>Developers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Women Techmakers Vienna events and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Women Techmakers members or the general public.</p>
