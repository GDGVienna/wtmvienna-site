    <h2>About Women Techmakers Vienna</h2>
    <p>
    People of all genders and abilities are welcome to attend our event. <br>
    As always, we try to focus on the accomplishments of technologists that also happen to be women or a person with a disability, rather than just focusing on the story of doing something as a woman or a person with a disability. This helps the focus be more of the work rather than our gender or abilities.
    We aim to keep things positive when selecting panels, talks, keynotes, etc. We know that we need more women in tech and inclusive workplaces and there are issues we face in the industry, but one of the most powerful things we can do to counter act that is to show that women and people with disabilities doing great things and what we are achieving.
