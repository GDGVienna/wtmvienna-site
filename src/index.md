    <h2>About Women Techmakers Vienna</h2>
      <p>
        Based in the heart of Vienna, Women Techmakers Vienna is a vibrant community dedicated to empowering women and people with disabilities in tech. We celebrate the innovative work and unique contributions of underrepresented voices in the technology field while fostering an inclusive environment where every individual can thrive. Join us as we share inspiring stories, host engaging events, and advocate for equality, diversity, and innovation in tech.

        People of all genders and abilities are welcome to attend our event.
        We try to focus on the accomplishments of technologists that also happen to be women or a person with a disability, rather than just focusing on the story of doing something as a woman or a person with a disability. This helps the focus be more of the work rather than our gender or abilities.

        We aim to keep things positive when selecting panels, talks, keynotes, etc. We know that we need more women and people with disabilities in tech and inclusive workplaces and there are issues we face in the industry, but one of the most powerful things we can do to counter act that is to show that women and people with disabilities doing great things and what we are achieving.
