    <h1>International Women's Day</h1>
    <p>Globally, International Women’s Day (IWD) occurs on March 8th every year. It marks a moment to celebrate and provide visibility for the incredible contributions of women around the world and is a call to action for accelerating gender parity.
    </p>
    <p>Each year, around International Women’s Day, the community gathers at the annual Women Techmakers Vienna conference. These conferences are organized during the year by a group of motivated people interested to work together to achieve our mission.
Women Techmakers Vienna is a non-profit organization and the work done is solely in the free time of each member, voluntarily.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Interested in sponsoring with us?</b> Let’s work together to make diversity not just celebrated — but the standard.
