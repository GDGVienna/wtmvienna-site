- **TIMEA**: Yep, right here.

- hello to all our podcasters hi ramon
- hey timaya and welcome christina
- thank you hi
- hi do you have a nickname christina
- not officially no but on social media i
- do i do use a nickname but i'm not gonna
say it people have to find it out okay it sounds funny if you say it out loud
so i'm not gonna say it
- but i am gonna call you chris though right that's
- yeah that's fine
i don't really consider that a nickname
it's just a short version of my name so
- okay thanks for um being on our podcast
um you are our first guest
- thank you i'm
really really honored to have that badge
thank you
- as are we we are so excited that you
agreed to to come and chat with us a
little bit about
what you've been doing and how um your
efforts towards gender diversity and and
equality have continued forward so yeah
i'm i'm super humbled no
- thank you
- so chris um
we go back a long time uh but still
we would like our podcasters to get to
know you a little bit better so let's
just start with
lose three random things about you
- i am a very big plant mama
and i've always been a plant mama but i
kind of
really gave into this hobby during the
quarantine
so now in a small apartment i am the
proud owner of over 50 plants
and this collection is is probably not
going to
become any smaller um i only learned how
to ride a bike
this year so i'm very proud of myself it
was
february it was raining and i just
bought a
bike and i went out and learned it and
after i learned how to ride a bike i
have not
ridden a bike anymore because it was
only the challenge
it was just doing it
- yeah but it was
also the lockdown
- yes that's true and a third random fact
is that i know a lot of random
facts like i know where cichlids
come from and i know which two lakes in
africa
have the most amount of cichlids and i
know what water ph
uh water should have for certain several
fish types
to live comfortably or you know spread
them facts mostly about animals
on yeah big animals fans
- feel free to
drop some of them
- most of the ones i know are dirty animal
facts so probably
not the best uh medium to draw
- because i was about to ask what is your
favorite one but i think we might not be
able to air it in that case
- no no i mean i can say it and you can
cut it out but i don't know if you want
the work
- no no let's let's go back to our a cup
of coffee and tea
- yes
- and to our
gender equality topic so one of the main
reasons
what why we've invited you today is
because
you took the challenge in 2016 to
organize uh one of the yearly women
techmakers vienna conferences so you
were
what we call a main organizer
- yes
- um
and i'd like to focus a bit on the years
that you did a lot of volunteering in
different organizations where we also
met
um and then converged to the topic of
gender equality
why did you get involved back then and
then going into what does it mean for
you
now with the role that you have so let's
just talk freely with
tell me about your volunteering years
- so uh funnily it started during high
school in coming from romania we were encouraged to volunteer especially if we
wanted to go abroad at some point and i started volunteering at habitat for
humanity they build houses for underprivileged people or people who can't
afford to get a loan via normal channels so they still have to pay for their
house but they only pay for the materials all of the construction work is done
by volunteers and i was one of those volunteers i had a chance to meet a lot of
international people a lot of companies are doing team building events where
they go and build houses um so it was a really really cool experience and you
really felt that you're doing something that matters and in that period i
realized that very often the people who were applying for these houses were
also either single mothers or women who were fleeing from abusive situations or
where they were the stay-at-home mom because they had to be the stay-at-home
mom because the husband was the only one who could have a job or who could
afford to have a job and someone had to stay at home to take care of the kids
so it wasn't i was a bit too young to kind of understand that this has to do
with gender equality um but thinking back you know hindsight is always 20 20 so
thinking back i kind of noticed this as well and then i continued my volunteer
path also during my student years on in an organization called board of
european students of technology where we also met actually and it's also funny
because it's a technical
student organization but i was studying
economics so
not really technical but right i mean i
was also doing construction work during
my high school years so
you know a lot of random stuff about me
and
i met a lot of different people during
that
my time in that organization obviously
women in stem and women in technology
is a big topic and i think oftentimes
people forget
that it starts at a very early age so
when you're already a student or when
you're already working as a woman in
stem
or tech you don't it's perhaps
sometimes a bit too late to kind of
learn new things
or to or it's very difficult to get rid
of all the
societal input that you've gotten over
the past two years even if it's in your
subconscious because you can't
really you just it's a feeling and very
often times it's difficult to put into
words
so obviously meeting a lot of women who
were studying
tech or studying i.t computer science
machine learn
engineering or whatever
i started to get a different feeling
about it i never really considered
myself a woman in tech because i was
studying economics and
most people who study economics are
women um even though most guys who win
nobel prizes
most people who win nobel prizes for
economics are guys very interesting
anyway
- it's true so but with the student
organization with best you had more
exposure to
the technical domains
- exactly yeah and i
i
have i started having more and more
discussions and
putting myself in the shoes or finding
myself
in the shoes of women in tech because i
was suddenly being considered a
woman in tech simply because i was
volunteering in that organization
right and growing up one of the
let's say unintended positive
consequences of communism in romania is
that
people of my our generation who grew up
they were never really discouraged
from studying anything technical because
during communism
it was you just do the thing you do it
doesn't matter if you're a
woman or a man um so i never
- was felt less of a bias basically
- exactly everyone was equal everyone was
the same and i never really had that
feeling that
i'm different or that i can't do what i
want because
of my gender and funnily enough i
started realizing this more and more
in the western world after moving to
vienna and
volunteering more and more in these
types of organizations
and
- then you did the volunteering in
best you did in
vienna
- i started in romania but most of
it was here in the uh i started in
romania yeah but most of it was here in
vienna
so i was part of the board here at the
technical university
um and i did a lot more events and
then the next step with your help was to
go
into women tech makers and being part of
the organization team and then actually
being the main organizer one year but
anyway it's obviously a team effort you
can't organize an event like that
by yourself it's insane um
- I think Ramon was already there by then 2016.
i don't think i think your sister pilate
was there
- Pilar was an organizer i i think i might have
attended 2016 was that the one in
microsoft
- yeah
- yeah no i sadly didn't make it
- yeah but it was it was a good event
uh and yeah it just kind of
it reinforced my belief that okay there
is something wrong in this environment
and
we should talk about it and we should
address it and obviously then i started
working in technical startups
where there the disparity
continues so um i try also to do within
my company
or um talking to other women in other
companies we're trying to maybe build
something up now
where we can support each other and
where we continue having this
conversation
so that as i said all of the things that
you learn and you have stored in your
subconscious can come out
and be broken and that you can grow as a
woman in tech
- so um from your story it seems like a
natural flow that you went into women
techmakers where you could
maybe get a better influence over the
situation or understand it more
and back then you were already working
with startups right
as i remember
- yes so i started at a
startup
then i moved on to an incubator uh where
i saw different kinds of startups and
now i'm
at a scale-up former startup
depends on your definition everyone has
their own definition of a startup
- okay so you're very much anchored in the
startup ecosystem and you
know the issues um for
women in startups and you are in a tech
startup
- um yes very much
- okay
and you say that you're looking to
network people
and women that are in this situation
- yeah so uh there was this plan with a
friend of mine laura
from mindmeister which is also quite a
successful startup you should have her
as well on
uh she's uh we are talking now
to uh make our own little
probably a meet-up at the beginning to
kind of
assess a bit the environment of women
in startups and see what they need and
continue
um i think the big difference that we
of how we want to do things is a lot of
these events focusing on supporting
women in tech
are women only and
if you have a conversation about a
problem
but you only talk amongst yourselves
it's very difficult to get the word out
and oftentimes
you need to have the the word women
in the name for example because you need
to make it clear
that you want to target women but having
the name or the word women
discourages a lot of men from attending
because
you have the feeling that it's only for
women so
and
- if you learn probably from from
women techmakers
- exactly
yeah because we were trying a lot to get
men as well to the event
and yes we actually heard the feedback
that but i thought it's a women-only
event because it has women in the name
- yeah that was kind of followed us for a
while
- exactly
yeah so we're trying now to we're only
in the brainstorm
phase um but we're trying to start up
something and see if it works and
obviously we're focusing first on on
andyline and mindmeister because we know
our our teammates
um but the next step is to then make an
official announcement and invite anyone
from the startup scene who wants to join
so um
- yeah tell us when that happens
because if it's one thing we love to do
at women time makers is to showcase
other communities and um gatherings and
meetups and
initiatives for that matter so that's
really cool okay
so you still keep this flavor of
volunteering and
in your life one way or another besides
the plan
- i mean i love my job and i love my
plants but i mean i do need to socialize
more with non-colleagues so i'm trying
to find
new ways of doing that while maybe
making an impact
- so i'm curious is there is there any
kind of
uh place where our viewers and listeners
could keep an eye on maybe
on our show show notes where an
announcement could come
- perhaps i mean i will definitely let you
know when there's something but as i
said we're only in brainstorming phase
now
nothing is official i think it's gonna
take a little bit of time
um but yeah no definitely i will let you
guys know
and i'm hoping that our as our community
grows
then we can do something together as
well i think yeah
bringing in different points of view is
is very very important
- absolutely and i think i think your idea
of exp of exposure
which is something that seems to
sometimes be lacking
is so key so i think it's really
interesting that you're approaching it
from this angle
um this idea of of communicating the
need for
gender gender diversity and equality
yeah yeah
super cool
- definitely
- i really i
thinking back on 2016 um i really like
that you brought in the community for us
back then
the whole topic of startups it was
something we haven't focused on before
the women in startups
and since then i've been also flirting
with startups myself
and started to understand some of the
issues that
um are in that environment um and
the event back then was focused
on putting uh female role models that
founded successful companies in vienna
for example on stage and that was great
because you had this community
this uh network that you could bring
into the event and i really enjoyed it i
fondly think about it and just recently
i watched
one of the videos the keynote from back
then
and i like that you're still and on the
same topic
and uh mixing them together at the same
time
um can you tell us a little bit
what some concrete issues that you see
um from gender equality perspective in
the startup world
and potentially what do you want to
pinpoint with your new endeavor
- so first of all i think a lot of these
initiatives focus on female founders
i think it's absolutely great to support
female founders
but i'm not a founder i'm a women in
tech in a startup and i don't want to be
a founder
i i'm not good at it and i know where my
strengths are
and so this would be one of the first
i wouldn't call it an issue but let's
say
i'm areas that we have identified is
that
there are a lot of women who are in tech
and who are struggling sometimes
um but they are not founders and there
isn't really a specific community
or guidelines or a program
that supports them as well you have a
lot of mentoring programs for founders
but you don't have mentoring programs
for just women in tech it doesn't matter
if you're a founder
um so that way
- you mean women in tech in
startups
- yeah yeah exactly okay so yeah we're
talking about the startups yeah yeah
um okay that would be the first one
second one this would be an issue i
would say is
startups of course came from the u.s
in a way or this concept and there's
this very
big mentality of the frat boy wearing a
hoodie
who's building their startup and i know
that in europe it's not as pervasive but
i have the feeling that a lot of times
especially because many startup founders
are young
suddenly enough successful startup
founders are not as young as people
would expect
but many first-time startup founders are
young guys
and they grow up with this idea that you
have to emulate
this american style founder and
unfortunately that also leads sometimes
to attitudes or to behaviors
that first of all are not as common in
europe second of all
they may actually discourage a lot more
women of joining a company or a startup
um than maybe in the u.s even because
maybe women are just used to it in the
us which is a very sad fact
if it's true but disclaimer i'm not sure
if this is true
so this would be the second one is
trying to
showcase that you
can be authentic and you should be
authentic in your leadership style
and having a balance between a more
aggressive
masculine way of thinking and a more
nurturing
feminine way of thinking is actually the
best way
to move forward because it's yin and
yang it's the balance in the world
of you can't just bulldoze your way
through things you you know you bulldoze
a little bit and then you sweep up the
little
branches that were not caught by the
bulldozer so very bad analogy
but but you know what i mean so this
this balance between a softer approach
and a more aggressive approach can
actually cater to a lot more people and
it can
it can help a varied type of people grow
um and i see that at any line is um
we have people from so many different
cultures
from america to south africa to
brazil um so you know romania
really everywhere and um and
some of them don't react to an
aggressive way but some do because
that's what they're used to
so you need to find this balance um
and this would be the second part so
let's say a bigger issue that i see that
i would like to address um trying to
showcase that people believe in
authenticity
and whether that authenticity is soft
caring nurturing or aggressive to the
point
uh yeah you know bullish even
there is a difference and that's fine if
you have different ways of expressing
yourself there isn't just
one way of behaving for you to be
successful
- yes and
being different and being authentic is
fine i think that's the
that's a very important message which i
wanted to underline because
what i've experienced in my um
environment so far is
women in startup situations as founders
or maybe as
members taking on this
uh bro culture
- yeah
- like trying to be one of the bros and
then it just
comes out wrong right like you see
the authenticity is totally out of the
window first of all
and then you just see like this mixed
signals that
you you don't even know what why they
behave the way they do
and then you start to understand that oh
this is the pressure the social pressure
of
being in this culture uh that makes you
portray some skills that you probably
don't even have
just to look tough
just to be included i don't know what it
completely is
but it was just awkward at the end of
the day
- yeah and this is something that
that not only applies to women it
applies to men as well
they're not all men have this way of
behaving or have this way of leading
uh there are many different kinds of
people in the world out there it doesn't
matter what gender you have
and showcasing the fact that you can be
yourself
is very important i once we did a
leadership course
uh last year and i asked the coach
whether
if this is the only way that i can
become a leader that i have to
yell and shout and be super aggressive
then i don't want to do this
and he had so much experience and i
asked him honestly like do you believe
that
i can grow in my role the way i am or do
i have to
behave like someone else please tell me
because then i don't want to go down
that path and he said actually that for
every
first of all you need to be authentic
all leaders in the world have this
common trait is that they are authentic
and second is for every one person that
is visible
and shouting out there there are a
hundred quiet ones in the background
who you don't know anything about who
are doing perhaps
a much better job so
yeah and i
- that's true
- and i really
believe in that
yeah i'm so happy that you brought in
the
aspect that this is not just affecting
women but all genders
yeah also men equally
um that don't want to
or don't fit in the bro culture
basically and at the same time
i see how you worked on yourself to
understand
uh to overcome this bro culture societal
pressure in a way
and discover that i think it's also
about what
what is woman leadership or what is
authentic leadership
right so i think we are still kind of in
transition and the society is trying to
understand that
hopefully we're going to see more
amazing women leaders like
the prime minister in new zealand has
always given us a good example yes so
i think you like her too
- yeah
- Ramon what is your
take on it
well listening to two women talking
about it
- well something that's been
bubbling in my head a lot as we've as
we've been having this conversation is
uh you know what the whenever i think of
the the the startup the startup
mentality
the phrase move br move fast and break
things comes up
right yeah and how actually toxic that
phrase is because there's you know
breaking things breaking
you know i i know it's meant to be cute
and like you know breaking
breaking industries or whatever but it's
also breaking people it's breaking deals
very much and what i find interesting is
when these these cultures are
called out or not maybe not called out
but also
given feedback let's say how
unreceptive they are and how slow to
change these are
because of hiding it would seem behind
a veneer of something like uh
business as usual you know business is
slow business is hard to change but i'm
young and i wear a hoodie
so move fast and break things but don't
tell me how to change please
and i and i'm curious because my my my
experience with startups is very very
minimal just from reading
you know social media and the news i'm
curious
given that you've been at this head for
a while do you feel that there is
some kind of reception to change coming
a little more actively lately or is that
still kind of
slow to adapt to different needs
different cultures
- or is this the reason why you're
creating a new community
- i can only talk about like austria
europe a little bit and i do see that we
have a different style of doing things
and it's also it's a combination because
of course
if most of the startups that are
successful have this
uh way of thinking of muslim
breakthroughs then of course people are
going to think that's the way
to go um because they are successful um
but i see a lot more our venture capital
uh firm rbc project a from berlin they
have a much more holistic way of doing
things they're much more supportive of
different ways
they they encourage you they want you to
grow but they also care about
the founders and the portfolio companies
they have and if you have
such a company in the background
supporting you then you are also more
confident that you can do things in a
different way
which we are trying to do um i i see
that there
is a distancing in a way from the
american style
of having a startup compared to the
european style of having a startup
yes that may lead to perhaps less
unicorns
but it also leads to a better quality of
life to
better happiness of the people to
even if you have successes if you're if
you have a
i don't know a 1 billion euro exit or a
2 billion euro exit
is that really any different like is
there really a difference between that i
mean
it's really it's it's difficult to say
in a way it sounds a bit eutopic
like it's you know money is not
everything of course money can make your
life easier
but um if there's still a difference and
if you want to have a clear conscience
that you did the things the best way you
could
and people are happy working with you
and you've achieved something together
as a team
then i think this is very very different
than um
the the type of culture we perhaps
originally saw with startups
and i feel that this is going in the
right direction in at least in europe
at least in austria
- that's a great
answer thank you
sorry I interrupted you
- for gender no it's okay the whole
gender topic
of why i want to want to start this
community is simply because i see a gap
um for communities supporting women who
are not
founders but still struggle with um
diversity issues and that is my main
motivation
because i can't go i can
still continue women technicals but
again i'm not
really a tech maker um even though i
align with a lot of the values of women
techmakers
i can't go to any startup founder
female mentorship programs because i'm
not a startup founder
but i am in a leadership role i am a
woman in tech
and i have 20 colleagues who are in my
position and who want to grow and who
struggle sometimes with
dealing with their senior male
counterparts or simply with their senior
counterparts
and if i can provide a little bit
to help them grow then i'm super happy
with that
so that's my main motivation of why i
want to do something
and i want to involve guys in the
discussion i don't want to start talking
about women in tech about you know only
with women because
that's only half of the problem like i
want to fix the entire thing not just
half of it
- it's really inspiring thank you so much well thank you
- let's ask chris one more
point about if you have any
resources or advice that you want to
drop
in the podcast for our listeners about
the context that you're coming from and
i want to know
mention one point
we have uh in the past in our conference
invited caitlin chang and she did a
talk um how to break the brotopian
uh cycle uh so we wanna put that in the
show notes because she talks exactly
about
um this uh brotopian bro
culture uh in her women techmakers
vienna talk
- yeah so um i completely agree with that
talk
the second one is just gather a lot of
knowledge that you can
so for that i would recommend the book
invisible women by um i think it's
carolina
maybe you have it in me yeah because you
borrowed it to me
yes exactly it's carolina
and it's just it's enlightening it's not
only about startups but just general
information about how the world is in a
way built
and um just read
all the books that you can uh even if
you don't agree with them
for example i read lean in by sheryl
sandberg i do not agree with it
it's an interesting book but it doesn't
fit me and
if it doesn't fit you either that's fine
but it's still an interesting viewpoint
to have just get a lot of knowledge and
then try and make your own opinion about
things i think that's the most important
thing
don't just
like don't don't don't get swayed in a
direction
like try and read the opposite of it if
it's you know it reminded me of one
video from the school of life
and one video was why you should have
children
and then one week later they uploaded
another video and the video is
why you shouldn't have children and
that's kind of the exact thing like you
have to look at
one two sides of the same coin because
only then can you form your own opinion
about things
so i think that's very important
regardless of what you read always read
the opposite
yeah
- very good
- awesome advice thank you
- yeah you're
welcome
- it has been an absolute pleasure to have
you chris
um before we let you go we'd love to ask
um
is there anywhere where our listeners
