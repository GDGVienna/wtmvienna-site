## Transcript

- **TIMEA**: Hey Ramón!
- **RAMÓN**: Hey Timea!
- **TIMEA**: Let's talk gender equality.
- **RAMÓN**: I love the idea. Gimme a second I just gotta grab my coffee, I hope you've got yours, too!
- **TIMEA**: Yep, right here.

- **TIMEA**: Hello to all our podcasters. Hi Ramón!
- **RAMÓN**: Hey Timea and welcome Krisztina.
- **KRISZ**: Thank you Hi.
- **TIMEA**: Hi, do you have a nickname Krisztina.
- **KRISZ**: Not officially, no, but on social media I
do I do use a nickname but I'm not gonna say it. People have to find it out,
it sounds funny if you say it out loud so I'm not gonna say it!
- **TIMEA**: But I am gonna call you Krisz though, right?'s
- **KRISZ**: Yeah that's fine.
I don't really consider that a nickname it's just a short version of my name.
- **TIMEA**: Okay thanks for being on our podcast,
you are our first guest!
- **KRISZ**: Thank you I'm
really really honored to have that badge, thank you.
- **RAMÓN**: As are we. We are so excited that you
agreed to to come and chat with us a little bit about what you've been doing
and how your efforts towards gender diversity and equality have continued
forward. I'm super humbled!
- **KRISZ**: Thank you.
- **TIMEA**: So Krisz
we go back a long time but still we would like our podcasters to get to know
you a little bit better, so let's just start with listing three random things
about you.
- **KRISZ**: I am a very big plant mama,
and I've always been a plant mama but I kind of really gave into this hobby
during the quarantine so now in a small apartment I am the proud owner of over
50 plants and this collection is probably not going to become any smaller.
I only learned how to ride a bike this year so I'm very proud of myself! It was
February it was raining and I just bought a bike and I went out and learned it
and after I learned how to ride a bike I have not ridden a bike anymore because
it was only the challenge, it was just doing it.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah but it was
also the lockdown.
- **KRISZ**: Yes that's true and a third random fact
is that I know a lot of random facts like I know where cichlids come from and I
know which two lakes in africa have the most amount of cichlids and I know what
water PH water should have for certain several fish types to live
comfortably, or you know spread them facts mostly about animals. Yeah big
animals fan.
- **TIMEA**: Feel free to
drop some of them.
- **KRISZ**: Most of the ones I know are dirty animal
facts so probably not the best medium.
- **RAMÓN**: Ah, because I was about to ask what is your
favorite one but I think we might not be
able to air it in that case.
- **KRISZ**: No, no, I mean I can say it and you can
cut it out but I don't know if you want
the work...
- **TIMEA**: No, no, let's go back to our cup
of coffee and tea.
- **KRISZ**: Yes
- **TIMEA**: And to our
gender equality topic. So, one of the main reasons why we've invited you today
is because you took the challenge in 2016 to organize one of the yearly Women
Techmakers Vienna conferences, so you were what we call a main organizer.
- **KRISZ**: Yes.
- **TIMEA**: And I'd like to focus a bit on the years that you did a lot of
volunteering in different organizations where we also met, and then converged
to the topic of gender equality. Why did you get involved back then, and then
going into what does it mean for you now with the role that you have? So, let's
just talk freely, tell me about your volunteering years.
- **KRISZ**: So, funnily it started during high
school in coming from Romania we were encouraged to volunteer especially if we
wanted to go abroad at some point and I started volunteering at Habitat for
Humanity, they build houses for underprivileged people or people who can't
afford to get a loan via normal channels, so they still have to pay for their
house but they only pay for the materials. All of the construction work is done
by volunteers and I was one of those volunteers, I had a chance to meet a lot of
international people a lot of companies are doing team building events where
they go and build houses. So it was a really, really cool experience and you
really felt that you're doing something that matters, and in that period I
realized that very often the people who were applying for these houses were
also either single mothers or women who were fleeing from abusive situations or
they were the stay-at-home mom because they had to be the stay-at-home
mom because the husband was the only one who could have a job or who could
afford to have a job and someone had to stay at home to take care of the kids.
So it wasn't, I was a bit too young to kind of understand that this has to do
with gender equality, but thinking back, you know, hindsight is always 20 20 so
thinking back I kind of noticed this as well. And then I continued my volunteer
path also during my student years in an organization called board of
european students of technology where we (Timea) also met, actually, and it's also funny
because it's a technical student organization but I was studying economics, so
not really technical, but I was also doing construction work during
my high school years, so you know, a lot of random stuff about me and I met a lot
of different people during that my time in that organization, obviously women in
STEM and women in technology is a big topic, and I think oftentimes people
forget that it starts at a very early age. So when you're already a student or
when you're already working, as a woman in STEM or tech, it's perhaps
sometimes a bit too late to kind of learn new things, or it's very
difficult to get rid of all the societal input that you've gotten over the past
two years, even if it's in your subconscious, because it's a feeling and very
often times it's difficult to put into words, so
obviously meeting a lot of women who were studying tech or studying I.T,
computer science, machine learning, engineering or whatever. I started to get a
different feeling about it. I never really considered myself a woman in tech
because I was studying economics and most people who study economics are women,
even though most people who win nobel prizes for economics are guys. Very
interesting. Anyway...
- **TIMEA**: It's true. So but with the student
organization with BEST you had more exposure to the technical domains.
- **KRISZ**: Exactly yeah and I started having more and more
discussions and putting myself in the shoes or finding myself in the shoes of
women in tech because I was suddenly being considered a woman in tech simply
because I was volunteering in that organization right and growing up one of
the, let's say, unintended positive consequences of communism in Romania is
that people of my our generation who grew up, they were never really
discouraged from studying anything technical because during communism it was
'you just do the thing you do' it doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man, so
I never....
- **TIMEA**: Was felt less of a bias, basically.
- **KRISZ**: Exactly, everyone was equal, everyone was
the same, and I never really had that feeling that I'm different or that I
can't do what I want because of my gender and funnily enough I started
realizing this more, and more, in the western world after moving to Vienna and
volunteering more and more in these types of organizations and.
- **TIMEA**: Then you did the volunteering in
best you did in Vienna.
- **KRISZ**: I started in romania but most of
it was here. I started in Romania yeah but most of it was here in Vienna. So I
was part of the board here at the technical university, and I did a lot more
events and then the next step with your help was to go into Women Techmakers
and being part of the organization team and then actually being the main
organizer one year. But anyway, it's obviously a team effort. You can't organize
an event like that by yourself, it's insane.
- **TIMEA**: I think Ramón was already there by then, 2016.
- **KRISZ**: I think your sister Pilar
was there.
- **RAMÓN**: Pilar was an organizer. I might have
attended 2016 was that the one in Microsoft.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah, no, I sadly didn't make it.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah, it was a good event.
And yeah it reinforced my belief that okay there is
something wrong in this environment and we should talk about it and we should
address it and obviously then I started working in technical startups where
there the disparity continues so I try also to do within my company or
talking to other women in other companies, we're trying to maybe build something
up now where we can support each other and where we continue having this
conversation, so that as I said all of the things that you learn and you have
stored in your subconscious can come out and be broken and that you can grow as
a woman in tech.
- **TIMEA**: So from your story it seems like a
natural flow that you went into women techmakers where you could maybe get a
better influence over the situation or understand it more and back then you
were already working with startups, right?
- **KRISZ**: Yes, so I started at a
startup then I moved on to an incubator where I saw different kinds of
startups and now I'm at a scale-up former startup depends on your definition
everyone has their own definition of a startup.
- **TIMEA**: Okay, so you're very much anchored in the
startup ecosystem and you know the issues for women in startups in a tech startup.
- **KRISZ**: Yes, very much.
- **TIMEA**: Okay,
and you say that you're looking to network people and women that are in this
situation.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah so there was this plan with a
friend of mine laura from mindmeister which is also quite a successful startup
you should have her as well on, we are talking now to make our
own little, probably a meet-up at the beginning, to kind of assess a bit the
environment of women in startups and see what they need and continue. I think
the big difference that we of how we want to do things is a lot of these events
focusing on supporting women in tech are women-only, and if you have a
conversation about a problem but you only talk amongst yourselves it's very
difficult to get the word out and oftentimes you need to have the the word
women in the name for example because you need to make it clear that you want
to target women but having the name or the word women discourages a lot of men
from attending because you have the feeling that it's only for women.
- **TIMEA**: You learned probably from
Women Techmakers.
- **KRISZ**: Exactly, because we were trying a lot to get men as well to the event and yes we
actually heard the feedback that "but I thought it's a women-only event because
it has women in the name".
- **TIMEA**: Yeah that was kind of followed us for a
while.
- **KRISZ**: Exactly
yeah, so we're trying now to we're only in the brainstorm phase but we're
trying to start up something and see if it works and obviously we're focusing
first on Anyline and MindMeister because we know  our teammates but
the next step is to then make an official announcement and invite anyone from
the startup scene who wants to join.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah tell us when that happens
because if it's one thing we love to do at Women Techmakers is to showcase
other communities and gatherings and meetups and initiatives for that matter so
that's really cool! Okay, so you still keep this flavor of volunteering and in
your life one way or another besides the plan?
- **KRISZ**: I mean I love my job and I love my
plants but I mean I do need to socialize more with non-colleagues so I'm trying
to find new ways of doing that while maybe making an impact.
- **RAMÓN**: So I'm curious is there is there any
kind of place where our viewers and listeners could keep an eye on, maybe on
our show show notes where an announcement could come.
- **KRISZ**: I mean I will definitely let you
know when there's something but as I said we're only in brainstorming phase now
nothing is official I think it's gonna take a little bit of time. But yeah, no,
definitely I will let you guys know and I'm hoping that our as our community
grows then we can do something together as well I think yeah bringing in
different points of view is is very very important.
- **RAMÓN**: Absolutely, and I think your idea
of exposure which is something that seems to sometimes be lacking is so key. So
I think it's really interesting that you're approaching it from this angle,
this idea of communicating the need for gender diversity and equality.
- **TIMEA**: Thinking back on 2016 I really like
that you brought in the community for us back then the whole topic of startups.
It was something we haven't focused on before, the women in startups and since
then I've been also flirting with startups myself and started to understand
some of the issues that are in that environment and the event back then was
focused on putting female role models that founded successful companies in
Vienna, for example on stage and that was great because you had this community,
this network that you could bring into the event and I really enjoyed it. I
fondly think about it and just recently I watched one of the videos, the
keynote from back then and I like that you're still on the same topic and
mixing them together at the same time.  Can you tell us a little bit what some
concrete issues that you see from gender equality perspective in the startup
world and potentially what do you want to pinpoint with your new endeavor?
- **KRISZ**: So first of all I think a lot of these
initiatives focus on female founders I think it's absolutely great to support
female founders, but I'm not a founder. I'm a women in tech in a startup and I
don't want to be a founder I'm not good at it and I know where my strengths are
and so this would be one of the first, I wouldn't call it an issue, but let's
say in areas that we have identified is that there are a lot of women who are
in tech and who are struggling sometimes but they are not founders and there
isn't really a specific community or guidelines or a program that supports
them. As well you have a lot of mentoring programs for founders but you don't
have mentoring programs for just women in tech it doesn't matter if you're a
founder so that way.
- **TIMEA**: You mean women in tech in
startups.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah exactly. Okay so yeah, we're
talking about the startups, yeah okay that would be the first one.  Second one,
this would be an issue I would say is startups of course came from the U.S in a
way or this concept and there's this very big mentality of the frat boy wearing
a hoodie who's building their startup and I know that in Europe it's not as
pervasive but I have the feeling that a lot of times especially because many
startup founders are young (funnily enough successful startup founders are not
as young as people would expect) but many first-time startup founders are young
guys and they grow up with this idea that you have to emulate this american
style founder, and unfortunately that also leads sometimes to attitudes or to
behaviors that first of all are not as common in Europe second of all they may
actually discourage a lot more women of joining a company or a startup than
maybe in the U.S even because maybe women are just used to it in the U.S which
is a very sad fact if it's true but disclaimer I'm not sure if this is true.
So this would be the second one is trying to showcase that you can be authentic
and you should be authentic in your leadership style and having a balance
between a more aggressive masculine way of thinking and a more nurturing
feminine way of thinking is actually the best way to move forward because it's
yin and yang, it's the balance in the world and you can't just bulldoze your
way through things, you know, you bulldoze a little bit and then you sweep up
the little branches that were not caught by the bulldozer so, (very bad
analogy) but you know what I mean. So this this balance between a softer
approach and a more aggressive approach can actually cater to a lot more people
and it can help a varied type of people grow, and I see that at AnyLine, we
have people from so many different cultures from America to South Africa to
Brazil, so you know, Romania, really, everywhere, and some of them don't react
to an aggressive way but some do because that's what they're used to.  So you
need to find this balance and this would be the second part. So let's say a
bigger issue that I see that I would like to address trying to showcase that
people believe in authenticity and whether that authenticity is soft caring
nurturing or aggressive to the point, bullish even, there is a difference and
that's fine if you have different ways of expressing yourself there isn't just
one way of behaving for you to be successful
- **TIMEA**: Yes and
being different and being authentic is fine. I think that's a very important
message which I wanted to underline because what I've experienced in my
environment so far is women in startup situations as founders or maybe as
members taking on this bro culture, like trying to be one of the bros and then
it just comes out wrong right, like you see the authenticity is totally out of
the window, first of all, and then you just see these mixed signals that you
don't even know why they behave the way they do and then you start to
understand that, oh, this is the pressure, the social pressure of being in this
culture that makes you portray some skills that you probably don't even have
just to look tough just to be included. I don't know what it completely is, but
it was just awkward at the end of the day.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah, and this is something that
that not only applies to women it applies to men as well.  They're- Not all men
have this way of behaving or have this way of leading there are many different
kinds of people in the world out there. It doesn't matter what gender you have
and showcasing the fact that you can be yourself is very important. Once we did
a leadership course last year and I asked the coach whether if this is the only
way that I can become a leader, that I have to yell and shout and be super
aggressive, then I don't want to do this and he had so much experience and I
asked him honestly like "Do you believe that I can grow in my role the way I am
or do I have to behave like someone else please tell me because then I don't
want to go down" that path and he said actually that for every first of all you
need to be authentic.  All leaders in the world have this common trait is that
they are authentic and second is for every one person that is visible and
shouting out there there are a hundred quiet ones in the background who you
don't know anything about who are doing perhaps a much better job, and I really
believe in that.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah I'm so happy that you brought in
the aspect that this is not just affecting women but all genders yeah also men
equally, that don't want to or don't fit in the bro culture basically, and at
the same time I see how you worked on yourself to understand to overcome this
bro culture societal pressure in a way and discover that. I think it's also
about what what is woman leadership or what is authentic leadership right, so I
think we are still kind of in transition and the society is trying to
understand that hopefully we're going to see more amazing women leaders like
the prime minister in new zealand has always given us a good example, so I
think you like her too.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah.
- **TIMEA**: Ramón what is your
take on it, listening to two women talking about it?
- **RAMÓN**: Well something that's been
bubbling in my head a lot as we've been having this conversation is you know,
whenever I think of the the startup mentality the phrase "move fast and break
things" comes up, right? And how actually toxic that phrase is because there's
you know breaking things, breakingm you know, I know it's meant to be cute and
like, you know, breaking breaking industries, or whatever, but it's also
breaking people it's breaking... And what I find interesting is when these
these cultures are called out or not, maybe not called out but also given
feedback, let's say, how unreceptive they are and how slow to change these are
because of hiding, it would seem, behind a veneer of something like, "business
as usual", you know? "Business is slow, business is hard to change, but I'm
young and I wear a hoodie, so move fast and break things but don't tell me how
to change please." I'm curious because my experience with startups is very
minimal just from reading, you know, social media and the news I'm curious,
given that you've been at this for a while do you feel that there is some kind
of reception to change coming a little more actively, lately? Or is that still
kind of slow to adapt to different needs, different cultures...
- **TIMEA**: Or is this the reason why you're
creating a new community?
- **KRISZ**: I can only talk about like, Austria,
Europe, a little bit, and I do see that we have a different style of doing
things and it's a combination, because of course, if most of the startups that
are successful have this way of thinking of move fast and break things then of
course people are going to think that's the way to go, because they are
successful. But I see a lot more our venture capital firm RBC project, from
Berlin they have a much more holistic way of doing things, they're much more
supportive of different ways, they encourage you, they want you to grow, but
they also care about the founders and the portfolio companies they have, and if
you have such a company in the background supporting you, then you are also
more confident that you can do things in a different way, which we are trying
to do. I see that there is a distancing in a way from the American style of
having a startup compared to the European style of having a startup.  Yes, that
may lead to perhaps less unicorns, but it also leads to a better quality of
life, to better happiness of the people too, even if you have successes if
you're, if you have, I don't know, 1 billion euro exit or a 2 billion euro exit
is that really any different? Like, is there really a difference between that?
I mean it's really, it's difficult to say in a way it sounds a bit eutopic,
like it's, you know, money is not everything, of course money can make your
life easier, but if there's still a difference and if you want to have a clear
conscience that you did the things the best way you could, and people are happy
working with you, and you've achieved something together as a team, then I
think this is very different than the the type of culture we perhaps originally
saw with startups, and I feel that this is going in the right direction in at
least in Europe, at least in Austria.
- **RAMÓN**: That's a great, answer thank you, sorry I interrupted you!
- **KRISZ**: No it's okay, the whole
gender topic of why I want to want to start this community is simply because I
see a gap for communities supporting women who are not founders but still
struggle with diversity issues and that is my main motivation because I can
still continue women technicals but again I'm not really a tech maker, even
though I align with a lot of the values of Women Techmakers, I can't go to any
startup founder female mentorship programs because I'm not a startup founder
but I am in a leadership role I am a woman in tech and I have 20 colleagues who
are in my position and who want to grow and who struggle sometimes with dealing
with their senior male counterparts or simply with their senior counterparts
and if I can provide a little bit to help them grow then I'm super happy with
that.  So that's my main motivation of why I want to do something and I want to
involve guys in the discussion I don't want to start talking about women in
tech about you know only with women because that's only half of the problem,
like I want to fix the entire thing not just half of it.
- **RAMÓN**: It's really inspiring, thank you so much. Well, thank you.
- **TIMEA**: Let's ask chris one more
point about: if you have any resources or advice that you want to drop in the
podcast for our listeners about the context that you're coming from and I want
to mention one point we have in the past in our conference invited Kaitlyn
Chang and she did a talk "How to break the brotopian cycle", so we wanna put
that in the show notes because she talks exactly about this brotopian bro
culture, in her Women Techmakers Vienna talk.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah so I completely agree with that
talk
the second one is just gather a lot of
knowledge that you can
so for that I would recommend the book
Invisible Women by, I think it's
Caroline,
maybe you have it.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah, because you
borrowed it to me
- **KRISZ**: Yes exactly, it's Caroline Criado Perez
and it's just, it's enlightening. It's not only about startups but just general
information about how the world is in a way built, and just read all the books
that you can even if you don't agree with them.  For example I read "Lean In"
by Sheryl Sandberg, I do not agree with it, it's an interesting book but it
doesn't fit me and if it doesn't fit you either, that's fine, but it's still an
interesting viewpoint to have. Just get a lot of knowledge and then try and
make your own opinion about things, I think that's the most important thing,
don't just don't get swayed in a direction.  Try and read the opposite of it,
if it's you know, it reminded me of one video from the School of Life and one
video was 'why you should have children' and then one week later they uploaded
another video and the video is "why you shouldn't have children" and that's
kind of the exact thing like you have to look at one two sides of the same coin
because only then can you form your own opinion about things, so I think that's
very important, regardless of what you read, always read the opposite
- **TIMEA**: Very good.
- **RAMÓN**: Awesome advice thank you.
- **KRISZ**: Yeah you're
welcome.
- **RAMÓN**: It has been an absolute pleasure to have
you Krisz. Before we let you go we'd love to ask: is there anywhere where
our listeners and viewers can follow you or follow your work that you would
like to give a shout out.
- **KRISZ**: I'm gonna sound super corporate now but
LinkedIn is the the, my social media of choice.  Instagram if you want to see
my plants.
- **RAMÓN**: There we go, I'll link both of those in
the show notes.
-  **KRISZ**: Pleasure talking to you guys, thank you
so much for the invitation
and super, super happy to be the first
one on your podcast.
I'm very excited.
- **RAMÓN**: The pleasure is all
ours, thank you so much.
- **TIMEA**: Thank you
it was very lovely, and thank you to all our podcast listeners. This was a
flavor of one of our podcasts with having a guest over so we're very happy, and
stay tuned!
- **RAMÓN**: See you next time!
- **KRISZ**: Bye!
- **TIMEA**: Are you on the forefront of gender equality? You are invited on our podcast.
- **RAMÓN**: That's right! Or maybe you know somebody
that we could have a chat with on gender equality? You should totally get in
touch with us! We're on twitter @GenderCoffee or any of the other contact
methods on our show notes. We would love to you to get in touch and for us to
have a chat.
