## Transcript

- **TIMEA**: Hey Ramón!
- **RAMÓN**: Hey Timea!
- **TIMEA**: Let's talk gender equality.
- **RAMÓN**: I love the idea. Gimme a second I just gotta grab my coffee, I hope you've got yours, too!
- **TIMEA**: Yep, right here.
- **RAMÓN**: Welcome to another episode of "Gender
    Equality over Coffee"! I am so excited to have the two of you here. We are
    joined today by Eva Lettner.
- **TIMEA**: Hi Eva! Hi everybody!
- **RAMÓN**: Eva is
    an incredible person, we are so happy to have you here today. Yeah I figured
    I won't do the talking, Eva why don't you tell us, do you have a fun
    nickname for us that you'd like to share?
- **EVA**: I don't have a nickname since my name is
    so short, no, nobody's ever bothered to make a nickname. When people call me a
    nickname they usually prolong my name, so yeah I'm just Eva.
    On the internet I'm @eva_trostlos which is a play on words for
    my husband's last name.
- **RAMÓN**: Oh! I never knew that.
    Well, why don't we start off, letting loose, why don't you tell us a little bit
    about yourself? Maybe some three random things about you?
- **EVA**: Some three random things... I make my
    own clothes! I collect fountain pens, this is my newest addition. I love it very
    much it's very pretty.
- **TIMEA**: Wow yeah that's cool.
- **EVA**: And I'm teaching myself to play the
    piano for two years now.
- **RAMÓN**: That's awesome. I love it when people tell us
    about things that that that are outside of
    their regular things that you see them in. Timea, do you play any instruments?
- **EVA**: No I don't but I was actually interested in piano a while
    ago so I got stuck on that point, but I never it never picked up I don't have a
    keyboard at home so that kind of a keyboard but I gotta say I was thinking
    more about the collection like do I collect something. Do you collect something
    Ramón?
- **RAMÓN**: Do I collect something... I collect
    random things at home probably mostly Nintendo things it's a bad habit of mine
    old Gameboys I really like old Gameboys
- **TIMEA**: I've seen some of you had some with
    some meetups and I was like wow I've never seen some stuff like this
    earlier and cute.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah that's a little bit
    of my background, yeah. So Eva you were
    keynoting at our Women Techmakers
    conference a few years ago I think it
    was 2017...
- **TIMEA**: 19! Not that far away
- **EVA**: Yeah but then 2020 took 38 years, so...
- **RAMÓN**: It just feels like a different amount
    of time! I'm curious what how did you get connected with Women Techmakers
    Vienna?
- **EVA**: Wow, that's, actually I went to Women
    Techmakers conference ages ago, I don't even remember if I was already
    working in tech or if I was just starting out but it was the first conference I
    ever went to.
- **TIMEA**: Oh yeah! I feel super,
    like, wow, okay, we were the first conference, cool!
- **EVA**: Yeah so it was either right after I
    started working in tech or just before. And it was just, it felt so great there
    were so many cool people there and I met people that I'm still friends with
    now, like Pilar, who is Ramón's sister, I met her there and it was just a very
    nice atmosphere and I felt very empowered from all the speeches and it's just
    it gave me the feeling that a woman can actually do things in tech and can be
    influential in a way and also this was when I saw myself first on stage, I saw
    those women speak and I was like "Oh I'm gonna do that too".
- **TIMEA**: Wow.
- **EVA**: And I was terrified of public speaking all of my life it's just
    nothing I ever anticipated doing it was nothing I ever looked forward to but
    when I went to the conference and I saw those women speak I was like 'Yeah I'm
    gonna do that too at some point'. And I don't remember what year it was, it was
    either 2016 or 2017. Then I went to the conference and yeah! So things
    happened and I wanted to volunteer for Women Techmakers at some point but
    I didn't get really into it because I ran out and it was just very, I had
    a lot to do and it was just a little bit too stressful, but then Timea
    and I stayed in contact and eventually she asked me if I would give
    give a talk at Women Techmakers and obviously I was like 'yeah sure'.
- **TIMEA**: Wow I have
    so many actually follow-up questions on these points, and you are by now a
    public figure for me especially. Since you became a Google Developer Expert
    and so if one Googles your name you they can find talks with you. You've been
    at meetups, spoke at conferences with over a thousand people, so that's amazing,
    and the one point I want to catch on to is, in german there's a
    specific word for this I really like. It's "quereinsteigerin".
- **EVA**: Oh yeah.
- **TIMEA**: Right, so you actually changed your
    profession, yeah, I want you to tell us a little bit about that aspect.
- **EVA**: Yeah,
    so initially I wanted to be a linguist. I started studying historical
    linguistics at university, and I was close to the end like I was already writing
    my thesis and I was working in in a project already, and it was all nicely laid
    out I have my plan, I will get my masters then I would get my PHD and I would
    become a linguist. And now comes the sad part of the story because then my
    mother got cancer and I lost steam on uni. It was just, I couldn't focus on
    anything anymore, it was just getting through all these hurdles and and making
    it through to the next day, and so that took two and a half years, then my
    mother passed away, and I found myself with "Okay what am I doing now?"
    because I can't go back to uni, I'm too far away now and I stopped studying
    so I was there without perspective and without anything so I had some random
    jobs here and there, I didn't want to be anything in particular so it just
    bounced around, and I had different careers until at some point I thought
    "Hey, there was this one thing that you did as a teenager that you really enjoyed,
    it was building websites, but then somebody told you that you can't do that as a
    career!" And by then people did it as a career so I thought "okay you know what
    I enjoyed this i'm gonna try this" out and I got myself back into programming
    and I enjoyed it really much and yeah the rest is history I just got
    stuck in it.
- **TIMEA**: Uou got into programming,
    at least in one of the talks you mentioned you were basically teaching yourself
    is so or did you do any course or Google?
- **EVA**: I did a course but
    that didn't do much for me it. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the course,
    it was just, I was used to teaching myself things from uni and afterwards
    it's just like teaching myself, so I have prior knowledge so it was a lot easier
    for me to get into stuff, and the stuff that we learned in the course
    wasn't necessarily what I wanted to do. So there was loads of PHP, and that
    kind of stuff that just didn't interest me. I wanted to make things shiny and
    float!
- **TIMEA**: Right I remember at the
    devfest you had the talk about CSS, and that's how you did things
    shiny and nice and actually cute and nerdy I was, you know, I was trained
    in Java most of my professional years and I've seen you do these amazing
    things with CSS I was fascinated. Is that something that also got you
    excited into coding?
- **EVA**: Yeah I always
    wanted to stretch the boundaries of what is possible with a certain technology
    and I really got stuck in CSS because I like to be a creative but I can't draw.
    It's just, that's not in my skill set but for whatever reason maybe block stuff
    looks...
- **TIMEA**: You could draw with
    pixels actually!
    It looks so cool, you had this monster,
    let's put in the show notes, a link to,
    I think we still have the Devfest talk.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah should still be around.
- **TIMEA**: Right, on the
    YouTube channel we also make sure to link your keynote talk.
- **RAMÓN**: Absolutely, yeah.
    One thing that I've always appreciated about about your talk and your
    presence in general as a community member is this this desire to help
    people get inspired and and learn either, you know, by themselves or
    through whichever methods work for them best. I'm curious, what's your
    driving factor for, you know, getting others up and running, for example in
    this case front-end software developers.
- **EVA**: I teach myself through my own excitement.
    I'm a very excitable person and I get really excited about things very
    quickly and then I learn all about them. This is how I learn and this is
    how I also teach, I make people excited about things so that they want to
    develop themselves further because when I'm giving workshops and
    when I'm teaching it's not enough to just be in the workshop and do the
    things that I tell them to, that doesn't cut it. You don't become a developer
    from just being in a workshop you become a developer because you love it
    and because you're excited about it and you want to learn more. If you're
    not excited about it, it's that's not enough, that will not get you very far
    is my experience, so what I like to do is build up excitement and emotion
    about the topic so that you actually want to work on it, and that you want
    to get better at it, and I always say at the end of my workshops this is
    not enough this is this was for nothing if you don't do it now in your free
    time if you don't practice and learn more then you could have skipped this
    workshop, because it's no use, you have to be into the topic and you
    have to like it and enjoy it, which is also a bit of a problem in the whole
    tech industry because we are made to feel that unless we code in our
    free time, we are not developers, we are not real developers, but you really
    have to weigh in what your free time looks like and what you actually can
    do and what your job is and, yeah so that's the really that.
- **RAMÓN**: Absolutely and I
    definitely want to come back to that, but something you mentioned there
    about this desire to, you know, getting excited and getting others excited
    I think is a good opportunity to just briefly touch upon something that you
    started a handful of years ago with Barbara Ondrisek called Women && Code,
    so why don't you tell us a little bit about this this organization?
- **EVA**: Yes, we founded a non-profit organization
    that aims to get more women into tech, and our goal is to teach people:
    teach themselves and teach each other, so we we structured our courses.
    They are not really courses, they they are a communal workshop where
    everyone teaches each other and themselves. So our courses are structured
    like this: you show up, if you're there for the first time you you get a
    little sticker that has a 1 on it, and so you can flock to all the people
    that also have a 1 on it and you do a specific exercise. If you get stuck
    you look around the room and you find someone with a higher number than
    what is on your sticker and that person will be able to help you, because
    they have done that specific problem before, and that is the whole
    concept of it, so that we don't have to teach because teaching is very
    tiresome and if you do it for free, in your free time, it becomes even more
    tiresome because you're spending your free time on something that is fun,
    but also you need to make a living too, and yeah, so this becomes
    very very difficult with time and we did this once once or
    twice per week. Also, it wasn't sustainable to teach all the time and so we
    we came up with this concept of people teaching each other and that has
    worked out great! It's really fun and people have actually formed
    communities around this, and have made WhatsApp groups where
    they program together and learn together, people have become friends
    over this community, it's just really nice to see, and we wanted to
    have a hands-off approach as much as possible as the founders of
    this movement, because we want to enable women to take care of their own
    path and their own learning, just because that is something that you need
    to learn as a developer in the future too. And yeah, it's loads of fun.
    We are on an extended break now, though, because, first we took a break for
    mental health reasons, because it was a lot of work, and now we're
    taking a COVID break, because we we did these things in person, and the
    concept was always to have it in person so you can walk around the room and
    yeah.
- **RAMÓN**: That's awesome, I'm gonna put a link.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah,
    the link is a good point you have to, of course. I wanted to say that I was
    once at an event, participated as a tutor, and I liked the atmosphere and
    people were very open and there was no shyness of asking questions. That's
    something that is not a given in some events and I was actually fascinated
    of what intriguing projects some of the participants had they were more
    advanced than what I ever did in some regards and I was there as a tutor
    and I was like "okay maybe next time" I should just come as a participant, you
    know.
- [Laughter]
- **TIMEA**: And what I also liked is I've noticed
    that at these events, people are "quereinsteigerin", a lot of them so
    they are coming from different backgrounds and they want to use I.T or
    programming for their domains to empower them in their work, become more
    efficient or create something that is online available and that was, that
    would, I think this is what is definitely missing in a lot of tech, this
    multi-disciplinary aspect.
- **EVA**: Yeah, completely, and it was just very
    nice to see all those different perspectives, because we have loads of
    participants who come from a marketing background, because they want to
    learn what costs so much when they give this little task to a developer and
    why this is now 500 euros if it's just a button, and that
    is super interesting because they want to gain knowledge in order to be
    more powerful and to be more assertive in their jobs. They don't
    necessarily want to program themselves but they want to gain the knowledge
    so that they can be more assertive and that is super cool! That is just that,
    that keeps us going in this because we actually help them in their
    current situation, we don't need to change jobs but they will become better
    in in their current situation and that is just really awesome.
- **TIMEA**: So I find this to be a direct parallel
    of your experience and you wanting to give back so that other people can
    have this experience. Is this the spark that ignited the collaboration with
    Barbara on Women && Code?
- **EVA**: Yes I think
    that's exactly it, because getting into tech changed my life so much for the
    better, it gave me so much independence also on a monetary basis because
    obviously in tech we earn quite a lot more than in other professions
    which is sometimes very unfair, but it just gave me so much more power
    over my own life and I want to share this with other women.
- **TIMEA**: That's so beautiful and thank you for
    the work you do for our community.
- **EVA**: It's fun!
- [Laughter]
- **RAMÓN**: Well, going going back to what we're
    just touching up on briefly before I think something that
    comes with a lot of, you know, a lot with volunteering and, you know, getting
    your work out there, and trying to do work outside of work is a
    danger of what is, especially I found this year, to be a bit of an
    issue and this sort of hustle sort of culture that's come out, you
    know, people trying to to over extend their
    capabilities and, you know, come up with more ideas and projects and products
    and try to, you know, level up in whichever field, be it STEM or
    other, that they're in, and this leads to burnout a lot, and something that
    I've always admired and actually been inspired by you Eva is that is that
    you are very clear in this separation. So I've wanted to ask, especially
    for our listeners who are probably starting out and thinking, you
    know, "I can do this all day, every day!" Why is it so important to you to
    have this this separation?
- **EVA**: This is my private space. This is
    where I am creative. This is where I do my own things and I don't want
    to let work creep into this because I need to regain my strength, because in
    my job I use a lot of of my energy to be a professional... professional! And I
    lead a team at work, I need to have the energy to help people and to
    empower them so I need to regain my energy, and as an introvert I gain my
    energy from being alone, and just doing stuff with myself, so it's
    very important to me to have that distinction and especially also with
    volunteering and doing extra stuff outside of work, I need to have a certain
    amount of free evenings to me and also have time for my relationship and
    have time for friends, because most of my friends are outside of tech which
    is very healthy, put things into perspective, because we can get in a rut of
    going to this meetup, if it's not the pandemic obviously, but there was a
    time when every evening I was in a meetup and that was fun for a while but
    it was so draining, because there are so many people and so many
    conversations and you feel like you hustle all the time, because maybe this
    person will at some point give you a job and then, you know, this person and
    that person can mentor you and, whoa, but you also need the mind space to
    keep all of that in your head like who is who, and who do I ask for what, so
    this is just a lot of stuff that's in your brain and it's constantly
    in there, and so if you have trouble sleeping because you're
    constantly worrying about things and "have I said the correct thing to that
    person" and "I need to go to this meet up" and "I need to give a talk there"
    this will cost you a lot of energy, or at least that's what happened to me,
    and so at some point I decided "Okay I will say no and I will learn to say
    no", and this is very difficult. I think saying no is a very important skill
    and also realizing that when you say no, you're not mean, you're not hurting
    anyone, you're just saying "No, I can't do this at the moment, maybe I will do
    it later, maybe I won't do it at all." It's just super important to be able
    to say "This is not in my capabilities now, I don't have time for this, don't
    have the energy for this". There's also the analogy with the spoons. You have
    a certain amount of spoons every day, ah, I don't have enough spoons for all
    of the things that I want to do and that people want me to do.
- **TIMEA**: This brings me to the
    title of your keynote which was, it had this word 'polymath' that I didn't
    even know before and the fact that 'the life of a polymath', that's the title
    which you described to be as a person that has eight arms involved in
    like an octopus, involved with in a lot of projects, a lot of things
    at the same time, I found it very genuine and a very good insight into
    your personality and how do you deal with things in general, so I think
    it really fits. It's the word that sums up this tremendous energy
    that you put in the community and in the work and I identify myself with it
    and to be honest, this break because of the pandemic actually, was
    good for me because I could finally stand still and not go to a ton of
    meetups.
- **EVA**: Yeah.
- **TIMEA**: Right so I think for us this was
    not a bad break in that sense.
- **EVA**: Oddly enough
    I planned for 2020 to be my year of not speaking, so I had planned before we
    knew about the virus in anything I had planned to not give a single talk
    for the whole year I could I didn't travel, I didn't want to go anywhere, I
    didn't want to do meetups, I didn't want to do anything, I wanted to be quiet
    for a whole year. I didn't know that my wish would extend to the whole
    world I'm very sorry for that, but yeah it was taken care of.
- **RAMÓN**: I hope that being here with us doesn't
    count as one of those activities!
- **EVA**: Oh no not at all!
- **TIMEA**: Hey, we're
    drinking coffee here, come on, yeah enjoy a friendly chat! Yeah and by
    the way, friendly chat, thinking about your polymath story and you also
    mentioned something like that basically translates in the fact that you
    sometimes get very easily bored of projects, ideas, tasks, you like to
    switch which also would potentially mean that you switch jobs and I also
    have quite some switches in my past 10 years of experience on my CV but in
    summer when I was trying to land the job someone asked from an HR
    department, you know, "why do you switch jobs so often?" because it was in my
    CV do you did you ever get this question?
- **EVA**: Yes.
- **TIMEA**: How do you deal with it, give me a hint,
    here give me a help!
- **EVA**: I didn't know what to say. I
    was speechless. That question I didn't expect, there are always
    different reasons of why you switch jobs, I mean sometimes you switch a job
    or at least I switch jobs when I can't learn anything anymore at this
    specific company, specific position, because either I don't get promoted
    or I just I reached the point in this company where where I can go and
    that is it, and I can't learn anything anymore, so what am I still doing
    there. Then there is also the case of, as women and we know this, there is
    data on this, you get promoted less often than men, so if I want a promotion
    and a raise I need to switch jobs most of the time, and that has happened
    for me in in a couple of situations where I wanted to to get a raise or
    get a promotion and I couldn't but if I switched jobs I would suddenly earn
    a lot more money, so that is also a reason to go. There are also multiple
    reasons, sometimes maybe in a job you get harassed, or you get
    discriminated against, or your male colleague will be promoted even though
    he has less experience, these are all things that happen all the time and
    these are all reasons to go, because why should I stick around if I have the
    possibility to go somewhere else, where somebody made me a great offer. But
    yeah especially in Austria we have this thing where you need to start at
    the company and you need to be there until you retire but that is still...
- **TIMEA**: Do you think it's fair
    that they ask you this?
- **EVA**: No I think it's horrible, because there
    are situations of why I needed to switch, and I
    have no problem explaining that to an HR person of why I went from that job
    and why I quit that job and where why I left there I will explain all of
    that to them but they are not interested, they don't care.
- **TIMEA**: I don't know, they see you like a
    fluctuation cost or they see was "Ah, this person, you know, is not loyal."
    Yeah, but I think the underlying point there would have been "Can I as a
    company offer this person that obviously is striving for more and
    learning? Can I offer that environment?"
- **EVA**: Yeah sure. That's what I just wanted to
    say if I'm willing to stay forever if you offer me an environment where I
    can grow, where I...
- **TIMEA**: Don't get bored...
- **EVA**: My skill set, and where I can grow and do all the things that I
    want to do and learn more things do more things get promoted when it's
    feasible, and when it makes sense, and be treated fairly, then I have no
    problem staying forever. I have not found the company.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah me neither so I
    was looking into founding my own actually but basically the question
    basically you would go into explaining the HR person for each job the
    reason?
- **EVA**: I have done that before but they don't
    care.
- **TIMEA**: Okay, so that doesn't it's not
    necessarily helpful, but that's the truth in the end of the day, yeah.
- **RAMÓN**: So I can't freely,
    no, I can't speak from experience because I've never actually
    worked full time before but I get the feeling from conversations with other
    people that this is kind of a vestige from an older
    generation, an older world, where where benefits and incentives could
    keep people in a company for their entire career, and I find that especially
    in in a software development, and I'm sorry to call it this, but a
    bubble I feel like this is kind of a norm now, and expected of people to be
    able to jump between companies once every one to two years, and that it's
    healthy and encouraged, you know. STEM is
    a completely different case for for people
    working in something other than software engineering.
- **TIMEA**: Oh, I've researched this topic
    and I think I can do a whole podcast just on that.
- **RAMÓN**: I think we found our topic for another
    episode.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah! But let's
    let's leave it to another time, because I'm of a different opinion about
    that. I just wanted, from another woman in I.T to see how she deals
    with this bias of HR people, which I found out to be something
    quite extensive happening in between millennials, that they switch jobs
    often and I'm hoping that somehow the next generation is more loyal if
    the company also you know invests in them to be loyal.
- **EVA**: I wish companies would learn
    that they can keep even millennials, if they provide a nurturing
    environment, but they are many companies that are still stuck in the old
    ways. My dad started his job when he was 17. He's still in this company
    and he will retire there.
- **TIMEA**: And that's not bad but
    we just want a little bit more like maybe a learning budget, yeah that's
    something that I always appreciate in job offers.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah it sounds like we're going to
    have to really research and go into it, I definitely got to read up on this
    and get ready for a big throw down we have one to talk about. Well
    let's not not keep you forever Eva I know you're busy and got stuff to do. One question that we always
    ask our guests here is, this is a big purpose of this podcast
    is to for people to be able to find where they can do their volunteering,
    how they can find mentors, and get started in doing their part to improve
    the intersectionality and inclusivity of organizations and
    and activities and so I'm wondering, do you have any advice that
    you would like to pass on to people that are interested in starting
    out here?
- **TIMEA**: Or quereinstegerinnen?
- **RAMÓN**: Them, yeah, I'm not going to try and
    pronounce that.
- **TIMEA**: It's a mouthful for me too but I like
    the word.
- **EVA**: There are actually programs where you
    can sign up if you're starting out and you want a mentor, one of these
    programs actually was developed and was the idea was born in a
    hackathon that Barbara and I organized and it's called Womentor so it's
    mentors for women and it's, there's those women that actually founded
    the organization, I think they got to know each other through Women &&
    Code, or at least they were part of the Women && Code community and that is
    super awesome.
- **TIMEA**: Cool, right, because this is what
    happens at Women Techmakers too and I'm always so proud of that sparking
    and empowering other communities to show up. Yeah I
    know we meant that I'm hoping we can get somebody on our podcast.
- **EVA**: Yeah!
    They had this great idea and it's just, it became a whole movement and
    yeah. I enjoyed it a lot. I know people who are mentored there I mentor
    somebody as well through Womentor. That's a structured
    approach to finding a mentor, because it can be super scary to just write
    to somebody if you want a mentor, that feels kind of weird.
- **TIMEA**: For introverts difficult to do,
    I myself like that.
- **EVA**: Yeah, so especially
    in a digital age in 2020 where we don't go anywhere, you can't meet
    potential mentors, so there are a couple of networks also internationally
    where you can actually find a mentor, some of them are paid but it gives
    you a good network of people that you can reach out to when you can go
    outside again, and when there are meetups again, obviously going to meetups
    and meeting people is super fun, going to conferences and then talking to
    the speakers is also really great ideam because you might think that's
    super scary but you can talk to one of the speakers because I enjoy talking
    to people and so does everybody else of the speakers that I know and we're
    just normal people that hang out at a conference, and it's completely
    normal to go up to us and ask us questions and chat with us, and have lunch
    with us, because there have been conferences where I had lunch alone,
    because nobody dared approach me. Yeah, so we are normal people! Please
    talk to us, it's fine we might be a little bit shy.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah, can relate.
- **EVA**: That's also a way to
    get to know people that are in the industry and that have their foot in the
    door already.
- **TIMEA**: Thank you for telling that aspect of how it is to be a speaker and
    eating lunch alone because people think you're, I don't know, unapproachable.
    Not true, people, not true.
- **EVA**: But I know from going to conferences
    before I was actually speaking there, I was like "Oh I can't talk to the
    speaker they are super famous", but that is not true, this is not a rock
    star thing, they are normal people, yes on stage and that talk
    about stuff that they're proud of.
- **TIMEA**: Most importantly everybody can be a
    public speaker and at Women Techmakers we try to make space also for
    newcomers, that speak the first time and are just passionate about their
    domain or their project.
- **EVA**: And you mentor them too, in making
    their talk professional, and losing stage fright, if they have it, and that
    is super cool! That's a great first time speaking experience because it's a
    very positive environment and yeah, speaking is super fun and it was very
    scary for me for the first time, but practicing in front of a small crowd
    first, and then giving the talk at a conference really helps, being
    prepared really helps, and yeah it's a lot of fun. You get so much energy
    from the people that listen to your talk.
- **RAMÓN**: That's amazing,
    thank you. Yeah I think to add on to that, if I may, one thing that I've
    experienced a lot with public speaking is that some folks that I think to
    myself these people could be amazing public speakers and I try to gently,
    very friendly, nudge them in that direction sometimes some folks really are
    just not interested in becoming public speakers, or the concept of being on
    a stage in front of dozens, hundreds, thousands of people is just not
    something they jibe with.  And I think it's important to remember, I guess
    I'm saying this more to 24 year old me if you feel like you should be on
    stage but don't want to, don't force yourself either.
- **EVA**: No of course not, it's not a career
    driver, I mean it is a little bit, but it doesn't give you more than than
    if you would just do your job that's it's completely fine to not do it.
    It's a great experience, especially when you can travel, you see different
    cities, you meet a lot of people, it's a cool experience, but if it's not
    something that you feel will benefit you then don't do it. Try it out and
    see if you like it but if you don't like it, it's fine it's fine to just
    listen it's fine to just go to conferences it's fine to watch them on
    YouTube, it's completely fine.  You don't have to be a conference speaker
    to be a developer, there is no such thing.
- **RAMÓN**: That's awesome, thanks a lot Eva. I think
    with that, we've taken enough of your time. We're so grateful that you
    could come on today, Eva.  One last tiny thing, is there anywhere that
    people can get in touch with you if they'd like to, or maybe a shout out
    you'd like to give to some organization that we can put in our show notes?
- **EVA**: I am reachable on Twitter it's the
    easiest that's @eva_trostlos and with the organization you just caught me
    off guard.
- **TIMEA**: women and code!
- **EVA**: Yeah but we are on break so I don't want to really
    advertise that until we are back.
- **TIMEA**: Okay, let's talk
    about it in the next episode.
- **RAMÓN**: All good! Well, thanks a lot see you next time have a good day.
- **EVA**: Bye!
- **TIMEA**: Bye bye to everybody!
- **TIMEA**: Are you on the forefront of gender equality? You are invited on our podcast.
- **RAMÓN**: That's right! Or maybe you know somebody
    that we could have a chat with on gender equality? You should totally get in
    touch with us! We're on twitter @GenderCoffee or any of the other contact
    methods on our show notes. We would love to you to get in touch and for us to
    have a chat.
