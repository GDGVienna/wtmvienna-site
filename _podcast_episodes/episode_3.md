## Transcript

- **TIMEA**: Hey Ramón!
- **RAMÓN**: Hey Timea!
- **TIMEA**: Let's talk gender equality.
- **RAMÓN**: I love the idea. Gimme a second I just gotta grab my coffee, I hope you've got yours, too!
- **TIMEA**: Yep, right here.
- **RAMÓN**: Welcome to another episode of "Gender
    Equality over Coffee"! I am so excited to have the two of you here. We are
joined today by Eva Lettner.
- **TIMEA**: Hi Eva! Hi everybody!
- **RAMÓN**: Eva is
an incredible person, we are so happy to have you here today. Yeah I figured
I won't do the talking, Eva why don't you tell us, do you have a fun
nickname for us that you'd like to share?
- **EVA**: I don't have a nickname since my name is
so short, no, nobody's ever bothered to make a nickname. When people call me a
nickname they usually prolong my name, so yeah I'm just Eva.
On the internet I'm @eva_trostlos which is a play on words for
my husband's last name.
- **RAMÓN**: Oh! I never knew that.
Well, why don't we start off, letting loose, why don't you tell us a little bit
about yourself? Maybe some three random things about you?
- **EVA**: Some three random things... I make my
own clothes! I collect fountain pens, this is my newest addition. I love it very
much it's very pretty.
- **TIMEA**: Wow yeah that's cool.
- **EVA**: And I'm teaching myself to play the
piano for two years now.
- **RAMÓN**: That's awesome. I love it when people tell us
about things that that that are outside of
their regular things that you see them in. Timea, do you play any instruments?
- **EVA**: no
no i don't but i was actually
um also interested in piano a while ago
so i got stuck on that point but i never
it never picked up
i don't have a keyboard at home so
that kind of a keyboard
but i gotta say i was thinking more
about the collection like
do i collect something do you collect
something ramon
- **EVA**: do i collect something um i collect
random things at home
probably mostly nintendo things it's a
bad habit of mine
old game boys i really like old game
boys
i've seen some of you had some with some
meetings
meetups and i was
- **EVA**: like wow i've never
seen some stuff like this
earlier and cute
- **EVA**: yeah that's that's that's a little bit
uh of my background
um yeah so eva you were
uh keynoting at our women techmakers
conference a few years ago i think it
was 2017
- **EVA**: 19 19 19 not that far away
- **EVA**: yeah but then 2020 took 38 years so
- **EVA**: it it just feels like a different amount
of time
um i'm i'm curious what how did you get
how did you
you know get connected with women
techmakers vienna how do you
find yourself leading there
- **EVA**: wow
that that's actually i went to women
techmaker's conference
ages ago i i don't even remember
if i was already working in tech or if i
was just starting out but it was the
first conference i ever went to
- **EVA**: oh yeah i feel super
like wow okay we were the first
conference school
- **EVA**: yeah so it was either right after i
started working in tech or just before
um and it was just it felt so great
there was
so many cool people there and and i met
people that i'm still friends with now
uh like
pilar um we don't know who is Ramon's
sister yes uh i met her there
and and it was just a very nice
atmosphere and
uh i felt very empowered from all the
speeches and and
uh it's just it gave me the feeling that
is a woman can actually do things in
tech and
can uh be
influential in in a way and also this
was
when i saw myself first on stage i i saw
those women speak and i was like oh
i'm gonna do that too
- **EVA**: wow
- **EVA**: and i was
terrified of public speaking all of my
life
it's just nothing i ever uh anticipated
doing it was nothing i ever looked
forward to
but when i went to the conference and i
saw those women speak i was like yeah
i'm gonna do that too at some point
uh and i don't remember what year it was
it was either 2016 or 2017.
then i went to the conference uh and
yeah so things happened and
um i i wanted to volunteer for
women techmakers at some point but i
didn't get
really into it because i ran out and it
was
it was just very i had a lot to do
and and it was just a little bit too
stressful um but then
tamiya and i uh stayed in contact
and eventually she asked me if i
if i would give give a talk at women
techmakers and obviously i was like yeah
sure
- **EVA**: wow i have
so many actually follow- **EVA**:up questions on
these points
and you are by now a public
figure for me um especially since you
became a google developer expert
and so if one google's your name you
they can find talks with you
you've been at meetups uh spoke at
conferences are over a thousand people
so
that's amazing and um
the one point i want to catch on to is
um in german there's a there's a
specific word for this
i really like it it's "quereinsteigerin"
- **EVA**: oh yeah
- **EVA**: right so you actually changed your
um profession yeah i want you to tell us
a little bit um
about that aspect yeah so
initially i wanted to be a linguist
i started studying uh historical
linguistics
at university and i was close
to the end like i was already writing my
thesis and
i was working in in a project already
and it was all nicely laid out i have my
plan
i will get my masters then i would get
my phd and i would become a linguist
uh and now comes the sad part of the
story because then my mother got cancer
uh and i lost steam
on uni it was just i couldn't focus on
anything anymore it was just
getting through all these hurdles and
and
making it through to the next day um and
so that took two and a half years then
my mother passed away
um and i found myself with okay what
what am i doing now
uh because i can't go back to uni i'm
too far away now
um and i stopped studying so
i was there without perspective and
without anything so
i had some random jobs here and there i
didn't want to be anything in particular
so it just bounced around and and i had
different careers
until at some point i thought hey there
was this one thing that you did as a
teenager that you really enjoyed it was
building websites but then somebody told
you that you can't do that as a career
um and by then
people did it as a career so i thought
okay
you know what i enjoyed this i'm gonna
try this out
uh and i got myself back into
programming and i enjoyed it really much
and and yeah the rest is is history i
just got stuck in it
- **EVA**: um you got into programming uh
at least in one of the talks you
mentioned you were basically teaching
yourself
is it so or did you do any course or
google
- **EVA**: I did a course um but
that didn't do much for me
it it wasn't necessarily the the fault
of the course it was just
i was used to teaching myself things
from uni and and afterwards it's just
like teaching myself
so i have prior knowledge so it was a
lot easier for me to get into stuff
um and the stuff that
that we learned in the chorus wasn't
necessarily what i wanted to do
so there was loads of php and and that
kind of stuff that just didn't interest
me i wanted to make things shiny and
float um so yeah
- **EVA**: right i remember that the um
the fest you had to talk about css yes
um and that's how you did things shiny
and nice and
actually cute and nerdy and i was i was
you know i was trained in java most of
my
in my professional years and i've seen
you do this amazing things with css i
was
fascinated is that something that
also got you excited into coding
- **EVA**: yeah uh like i i always
wanted to stretch the boundaries of what
is possible
with a certain technology and i really
got stuck in css because
i like to be a creative but i can't draw
it's just that's not in my skill set
but for whatever reason maybe
block stuff look
- **EVA**: you could draw with
pixels actually
it looks so cool you had this monster
let's uh put in the show notes a link to
i think we still have the device talk
- **EVA**: yeah should still be around
- **EVA**: right on the
youtube channel we also make sure to
link your keynote
talk
- **EVA**: absolutely yeah
one thing that i've always appreciated
about about your talk save and
and and your presence in general as a
community member is
is this this desire to help people get
inspired and
and learn either you know by themselves
or through whichever
methods uh work for them best and that
and i'm i'm curious
what what's what's your driving factor
there uh
for you know getting others up and
running as a
as in this for example in this case
front- **EVA**:end software developers
- **EVA**: i teach myself through my own excitement
i'm a very excitable person
and i get really excited about things
very quickly and then i
learn all about them um this is how i
learn and this is
how i also teach i make people
excited about things so that they
want to develop themselves further
because
when i'm when i'm giving workshops and
when i'm teaching
it's not enough to just be in the
workshop and do the things that i tell
them to
that doesn't cut it you don't become a
developer from just being in a workshop
you become a developer because you love
it and because you're excited about it
and you want to learn more
if you're not excited about it it's
that's not enough that will not get you
very far
is my experience so what i like to do is
build up excitement and emotion about
the topic so that you actually want to
work on it and that you want to get
better at it
um and i always say at the end of my
workshops
this is not enough this is this was for
nothing
if you don't do it now in your free time
if you don't
practice and learn more then you could
have skipped this workshop because it's
it's no use you have to be into the
topic and you have to like it and enjoy
it
which is also a bit of a problem in the
whole tech industry
because we are made to feel that unless
we code in our three free time we are
not developers
we are not real developers but
you really have to weigh in what your
free time
looks like and what you actually can do
and what your job is
and yeah so that's that's the really
uh that's
- **EVA**: absolutely and i i
definitely want to come back to that but
uh
something you mentioned there about this
desire to you know getting excited and
getting others excited i think is a
good opportunity to just briefly touch
upon
something that you started a handful of
years ago
with baba andersek called women in code
so why don't you tell us a little bit
about this this organization
- **EVA**: yes we founded a non- **EVA**:profit organization
that aims to get more women into tech
uh and our
goal is to teach people
teach themselves and teach each other uh
so we we structured our
courses they are not really courses they
they are a communal workshop where
everyone teaches
each other and themselves um so
our courses are structured like this you
show up if you're there for the first
time
you you get a little sticker that has a
one on it
and so you can flock to all the people
that also have a one on it
and you do a specific exercise
if you get stuck you look around the
room and you find someone with a higher
number than what is on your sticker
and that person will be able to help you
because they have done
that specific problem before uh
and that is the whole concept of it so
that we don't have to teach because
teaching is very tiresome and if you
do it for free in your free time
it becomes even more tiresome because
you're spending your free time on
something that is fun but also you
you need to make a living too and and
yeah so this becomes very
um it becomes very difficult
uh with time and we did this once once
or twice per week also
it wasn't sustainable to teach all the
time
and so we we came up with this concept
of people teaching each other
and that has worked out great it's
really fun and people have actually
formed communities around this
uh and and have made whatsapp groups
where where they
uh program together and learn together
um people have become friends over this
community it's it's just
really nice to see um and we wanted to
have
a hands- **EVA**:off approach as much as possible
as the founders of this movement
because we want to enable women to
take care of their own path and their
own learning
um just because that is something that
you need to learn as a developer in the
future too
and yeah it's it's loads of fun we are
on an
extended break now though because uh
first we
took a break for uh for mental health
reasons because it was a lot of work
uh and now we're taking a covet break
because
we we did these things in person um
and the concept was always to have it in
person so you can walk around the room
and
yeah that's
- **EVA**: that's awesome um i'm gonna
i'm gonna put a link to sorry
- **EVA**: yeah yeah
the link is a good point
you have to of course i wanted to say
that i was
once at an event participated as a
tutor and i liked the atmosphere and
people were very open and there was no
shyness of asking
questions that's something that is not a
given in some events
and i was actually fascinated of
what intriguing project some of the
participants had
they were more advanced than what
i ever did in some regards and i was
there as a tutor and i was like
okay maybe next time i should just come
as a participant you know
- **EVA**: [Laughter]
- **EVA**: and what i also liked is i've noticed
that
um at these events people are
"quereinsteigerin"  a lot of them so they are
coming from different backgrounds and
they want to
use ite or programming for their domains
to empower them in their work become
more efficient or
create something that is online
available and that was
that would i think this is what is
definitely missing in a lot of tech this
multi-disciplinary aspect
- **EVA**: yeah completely and and it was just very
nice
to see all those different perspectives
because we have loads of participants
who come from a marketing background
um because they want to learn
what costs so much when they give this
little task to a developer and
why why this is now fighting our euros
if it's just a button
and and that is super interesting
because they want to gain knowledge in
order to be more powerful
and and to be more assertive in their
jobs they don't necessarily want to
program themselves
but they want to gain the knowledge so
that they can be more assertive
and that is super cool that is just that
that
keeps us going in this because we we
actually help them in their current
situation
we don't need to change jobs but they
will become
better in in their current situation and
that is just really awesome
- **EVA**: so i find this to be a direct parallel
of
your experience and you wanting to give
back
so that other people can have this
experience is this the spark
that ignited the collaboration with
barbara
on women and code
- **EVA**: yes i think that's
that's exactly it because getting into
tech changed my life
so much for the better it gave me so
much independence
also on a monetary basis because
obviously in tech we we earn quite a lot
more than in other professions which is
sometimes very unfair
um but it just gave me so much
more power over my own life and i want
to share this with other women
- **EVA**: that's so beautiful and thank you for
the
work you do for our community
- **EVA**: it's fun
- [Laughter]
- **EVA**: well um going going back to what we're
just touching up on briefly before i
mean i think something something that
comes
with a lot of you know a lot with
volunteering and you know getting
getting your work out there and trying
to do work outside of work is
a danger of what is especially i found
this year to be a bit of a bit of an
issue and that is
this sort of hustle sort of culture
that's come out you know people trying
to
to over extend their their their cape
their capabilities and
you know come up with more ideas and
projects and products and and try to you
know level up as
which in whichever field be it stem or
other
that they're in and this leads to
burnout a lot and something that i've
always admired
and actually been inspired by you eva is
that
is that you are very clear in this
separation
um so i i've wanted to ask especially
for our listeners who are probably
starting out and
uh and thinking you know i can do this
all day every day
um why is it so important to you to have
this
this separation it's
- **EVA**: this this is my private space this is
where
where i am creative this is where i do
my own things
and i don't want to let work creep
into this because i need to regain my
strength
because in my job i use
a lot of of my energy to be a
professional professional
and i lead a team at work i need to have
the energy to
to help people and and to empower them
so i need to regain my energy and as an
introvert i gained my energy from being
alone
um and and just doing stuff with myself
so
it's very important to me to have that
distinction and especially also with
volunteering
and doing extra stuff outside of work
i need to have a certain amount of free
evenings
to me and also have time for my
relationship
and have time for friends because most
of my friends are outside of tech
which is very healthy put things into
perspective because we can get in a rut
of going to this meetup if it's not the
pandemic obviously
but there was a time when every evening
i was in a meet-up
and that was fun for a while but it was
so draining because there are so many
people and so many conversations
and you feel like you hustle all the
time because maybe this person will at
some point give you a job and then
you know this person and that person can
mentor you and
whoa but you also need the mind space to
keep
all of that in your head like who is who
and who do i ask for what
so this is just a lot of stuff that's in
your brain and
it's it's constantly in there and and um
so if you have trouble sleeping because
you're constantly
worrying about things and have i said
the correct thing to that person and i
need to go to this meet up and i need to
give a talk there
this will cost you a lot of energy or at
least that's what happened to me
and so at some point i decided okay
i will say no and i will learn to say no
and this is very difficult
i think saying no is a very important
skill
and also realizing that when you say no
you're not
mean you're not hurting anyone you're
just saying
no i can't do this at the moment maybe i
will do it later maybe i won't do it at
all
um it's just super important to
be able to say this is not in my
capabilities now i don't have time for
this
don't have the energy for this there's
also the analogy with the spoons you
have a certain amount of spoons every
day
uh i don't have enough spoons for
all of the things that i want to do and
that people want me to do
and yeah
- **EVA**: this brings me to um the
title of your keynote which was
it had this word polymath that i didn't
even know before
and the fact that the life of a polymath
that's the title
um which you described to be as a person
that has eight
arms uh involved in um like
like an octopus involved with in a lot
of projects a lot of things at the same
time
um i found it very um genuine
and a very good insight into your
personality and how do you
deal with things in general um
so i think it really fits it's it's it's
the
word that sums up this
tremendous energy that you put in the
community and in the work and
i identify myself with it and to be
honest um this
break because of the pandemic actually
is
is was good for me because i could
finally stand still and not go to a ton
of meetups
- **EVA**: yeah
- **EVA**: right so i think for us this was
not a
bad break in that sense
- **EVA**: oddly enough
i planned for 2020 to be my year of not
speaking
so i had planned before we knew about
the virus in anything
i had planned to not give a single talk
for the whole year
i could i didn't travel i didn't want to
go anywhere i didn't want to do meetups
i didn't want to do anything i wanted to
be quiet for a whole year i
i didn't know that my wish would extend
to the whole world
i'm very sorry for that um
but yeah it was taken care of
- **EVA**: i hope that being here with us doesn't
count as one of those activities
- **EVA**: oh no not at all
- **EVA**: hey we're
drinking coffee here come on yeah enjoy
friendly chat
yeah and uh by the way friendly chat
um thinking about your polymath story
and you also mentioned something like
that basically translates in the fact
that you sometimes get
very easily bored of projects ideas
tasks you you like to switch
which also would potentially mean that
you switch jobs
um and i also have
quite some switches in my past 10 years
of experience on my cv
but in summer when i was trying to land
the job
someone asked um from an agent
department
uh you know why do you switch jobs so
often because it was in my cv do
you did you ever get this question
- **EVA**: yes
- **EVA**: how do you deal with it give me a hint
here give me a help
- **EVA**: i didn't know what to say i was like i
was i was speechless
that question i didn't expect it yeah
there are always different reasons of
why you switch jobs i mean
sometimes you switch a job or at least i
switch jobs when i can't learn anything
anymore
at this specific company specific uh
position
because either i don't get promoted or
um
i just i reached the point in this
company where
where i can go and that is it and i
can't learn anything anymore so what am
i still doing there
um then there is also the case of
as women and we know this there is data
on this
you get promoted less often than men
so if i want a promotion and a raise i
need to switch jobs most of the time
and that has happened for me in in a
couple of situations where i
wanted to to uh get a raise or get a
promotion
and i couldn't but if i switched jobs i
would suddenly earn a lot more money
so that is also a reason to go there are
also multiple
reasons of sometimes maybe in a job you
get harassed or
or you get discriminated against
or your male colleague will be promoted
even though he has less experience
these are all things that happen all the
time and these are all
reasons to go because why should i stick
around if i
have the possibility to go somewhere
else where somebody made me a great
offer
um but yeah especially in australia we
have this thing of
you need to start at the company and you
need to be there until you retire
but that is still
- **EVA**: do you think it's fair
that they ask you this
- **EVA**: no i think it's horrible because there
are situations of why
i needed to switch and and especially
the
yeah and i have no problem explaining
that to an hr person of
why i went from that job and why i quit
that job and where
why i lived there i will explain
all of that to them but they are not
interested they don't care you just
see them all the time i suppose they
just see that
- **EVA**: i don't know they see you like a
fluctuation cost
or they see was ah this person you know
is not loyal or
yeah but i think the underlying point
there would have been
can i as a company offer this person
that
obviously is uh striving for more and
learning can i offer that environment
- **EVA**: yeah sure that's what i just wanted to
say if i i'm
willing to stay forever if you offer me
an environment where i can grow
where i
- **EVA**: don't get bored
- **EVA**: as as a
as a my skill set and where i can grow
and
do all the things that i want to do and
learn more things
do more things get promoted when it's
feasible and when it makes sense and be
treated fairly
then i have no problem staying forever i
have not found the company
yeah me neither so i was looking into
founding my own
- **EVA**: actually but basically um
the question basically you would go into
explaining
the hr person um for each job the reason
- **EVA**: i have done that before but they don't
care
- **EVA**: okay so that doesn't it's not
necessarily helpful but
that's the truth in the end of the day
yeah
- **EVA**: so i can't freely
no i can't i can't speak from experience
because i've
uh never actually worked full time
before but
i get the feeling from conversations
with other people that this is kind of a
vestige from an older from an older
generation an older world
where where benefits and and
and incentives could keep people in a
company for their entire career
and i find that especially in in a
software development and i'm sorry to
call it this but i
but a bubble i feel like this is kind of
a norm now and expected of people to be
able to jump between companies once
every one to two years
and that it's healthy and encouraged you
know especially
you know yeah so i'm i'm
stem is of course it's a completely diff
is also a different case
uh for for people working in something
other than software engineering
so yeah
- **EVA**: oh i've researched this topic
and i think i can do a whole podcast
just on that
- **EVA**: i think we found our topic for another
episode
- **EVA**: yeah yeah yeah but let's
let's leave it to another time because
i'm of a different opinion about that i
just
i just wanted from another woman in i.t
to see how she deals with this uh
bias of hr people which which i found
out to be something
uh quite extensive happening in in
between millennials that they switch
jobs often and i i'm hoping that somehow
the next generation
is more loyal if the
company also you know invests in them to
be
loyal
- **EVA**: i wish companies would learn
that they can keep even millennials
even yeah if they
provide a nurturing environment yes yes
but they are many companies are still
stuck in the old ways of
my dad started his job when he was 17.
he's still in this company and he will
retire there
it's
- **EVA**: and that's not bad but uh
he we just want a little bit more like
maybe a
learning budget yeah that's something
that
i always appreciate in job offers
- **EVA**: yeah yeah it sounds like we're going to
have to really
research and go into i'm i definitely
got to read up on this and and
get ready for a big throw down
we have one to talk about well um
let's uh not not keep you forever ava i
know you've got you're busy and you know
you've got stuff to do
uh i you know one one question that we
always ask our guests
here is you know for this is a big
purpose of this podcast is to
for people to be able to find where they
can do their volunteering how they can
find mentors and get started
in doing their part to improve uh
improve the intersectionality and
inclusivity of of
organizations and and and uh and
activities and so i'm wondering if do
you
have any advice that you would like to
pass on to people that that
are interested in starting out here
- **EVA**: or quereinstegerinnen
- **EVA**: them yeah i'm not going to try and
pronounce that
- **EVA**: it's a mouthful for me too but i like
the word
- **EVA**: um there are actually programs where you
can sign
up if you're starting out and you want a
mentor
uh one of these programs actually was
uh developed and and uh was the idea was
born
in a hackathon that pablo and i
organized
uh and it's called WeMentor so it's
mentors for women uh and and it's
there's those women that actually
founded the organization
uh i think they got to know each other
through women and code or at least
they were part of the women in co
community and that is super awesome
we're very
- **EVA**: cool right when because this is what
happens at women techmakers too and i'm
always so proud of that
uh sparking and empowering other
communities to show up
yeah yeah it's really i call i know we
meant that i'm hoping we can get
somebody on our podcast yeah
yeah they had this great idea and it's
it's just it became a whole movement and
yeah i enjoyed a lot i know people who
aren't mentored there i'm
i meant to somebody as well through
mentor uh
it's it's just a that's a structured
approach to finding a mentor
um because it can be super scary to just
write to somebody
if you want a mentor that feels kind of
weird
- **EVA**: for introverts difficult to do
i myself like that
- **EVA**: yeah so especially in
in a digital age in 2020
where we don't go anywhere you can't
meet potential mentors
um so there are a couple of networks
also
internationally where you can actually
find a mentor some of them are paid
but it gives you a good network of
people that you can reach out to
when you can go outside again and when
there are meetups again
uh obviously going to meetups and
meeting people
is super fun going to conferences and
then talking to the speakers
is also really great idea because you
might
think that's super scary and you can't
talk to
to one of the speakers because
i enjoy talking to people and so does
everybody else of the speakers that i
know
and we're just normal people that hang
out at a conference
and it's completely normal to go up to
us and ask us questions and
and chat with us and have lunch with us
because there have been conferences
where i had lunch alone because
nobody did approach me
yeah so it it's we are normal people
please talk to us it's fine we might be
a little bit shy
- **EVA**: [Laughter]
- **EVA**: yeah can relate
- **EVA**: that's that's also a way to
get to know people
that are in the industry and that that
have their foot in the door already
um thank you for telling that aspect
thank you for telling us this aspect of
how it is to be a speaker and
eating a loan lunch because people think
you're
i don't know unapproachable not true
people not true
but i i know from going to conferences
before i was actually speaking there i
was like oh i can't talk to the speaker
they are super famous
um but that is not true this is not a
rock star thing it's it's they they are
normal people
that yes on stage and talk about stuff
that they're proud of
- **EVA**: most importantly everybody can be a
public speaker
of course and at women tank makers we
try to make space all for for newcomers
- **EVA**: yeah
- **EVA**: that speak the first time and are
just passionate about their domain or
their project
and you mentor them too in in making
their talk professional and and uh
losing stage fright if they have it and
and that is super cool that's a great
first time speaking experience
because it's a very positive environment
and and
yeah speaking is is super fun
and it was very scary for me for the
first time
but practicing in front of a small crowd
first
and then giving the talk at a conference
really helps
being prepared really helps
and yeah it's it's a lot of fun it's you
get so much energy from the people that
listen to your talk
- **EVA**: that's amazing
thank you yeah i think
i think to add on to that if i may um
one thing that i've experienced a lot
with public speaking is that
a lot of folks sometimes some folks that
i try to think that i think to myself
these these people could be amazing
public speakers and you know i try to
gently very friendly nudge them in that
direction
sometimes sometimes some folks really
are just not
interested in becoming public speakers
or don't want to or maybe
the the the the the concept of being on
a stage in front of
dozens hundreds thousands of people is
just not something they jibe with
and i think it's important to remember i
guess i think i'm saying this more to
24 year old me um if you
feel like you should be on stage but
don't want to don't force yourself
either
- **EVA**: no no of course not it's not a career
driver
i mean it is a little bit but it's not
it doesn't give you more
than than if you would just do your job
that's it's completely fine to not do it
um it's it's a great experience
especially
when when you can travel you see
different cities you need a lot of
people it's a cool experience but
if it's not something that you feel
will benefit you then don't do it
or try it out and see if you like it but
if you don't like it
don't also find it's fine it's fine to
just listen it's fine to just go to
conferences
it's fine to watch them on youtube it's
completely fine
you don't have to be a conference
speaker to be a developer
there is no such thing
- **EVA**: that's awesome thanks a lot eva i think
i think with that i think we've taken
enough of your time we're so grateful
that you could come on today eva
um one last tiny thing um is there any
um is there anywhere that people can get
in touch with you that they
if they'd like to or maybe a shout out
you'd like to give to some organization
that we can put in our show notes

easiest

- **EVA**: women and code!

advertise
that until we are back
