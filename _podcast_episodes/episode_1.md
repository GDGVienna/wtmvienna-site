## Transcript

- **TIMEA**: Hey Ramón!
- **RAMÓN**: Hey Timea!
- **TIMEA**: Let's talk gender equality.
- **RAMÓN**: I love the idea. Gimme a second I just gotta grab my coffee, I hope you've got yours, too!
- **TIMEA**: Yep, right here.
- **RAMÓN**: I think is an excellent moment to segue into what women techmakers vienna is because we've got a lot to say about that we are both part of the women techmakers vienna organization and you've been around for much longer than I have, Timea! Why why don't you start by telling us what what women techmakers vienna is?
- **TIMEA**: Sure. Actually, I think January we will be have we'll have our eighth year anniversary since we founded the community in Vienna and it's  it started from the Google Developer Group which is a community of people interested in Google products and frameworks and technology alike and this big conference that happened yearly at Google in San Francisco. Well, the women that participated there were like "but it's kind of lonely around here where where are all the women" that come to these big tech conferences and I think that's the where the need actually started to push into "let's do something about it". So yeah, Women Techmakers was started at this one of these big Google conferences in San Francisco eight or nine years ago and through the Google Developer Communities they were like "hey, would you like to start a local chapter? We provide you with the name with the visual identity". We have our logo, colors, brands, all that just you know with the simple goal of bringing more women into STEM-
- **RAMÓN**: Sorry, STEM being?
- **TIMEA**: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
- **RAMÓN**: Right yes of course.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah so that was the beginning.
- **RAMÓN**: Awesome, and you been doing this, you said eight years in january.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah, I can't believe it, myself.
- [Laughter]
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah that's so that's eight years that you've been running a a yearly conference
- **TIMEA**: Yes, right, at the beginning we had a 50 participant meet up. To be honest we didn't call it conference quite the beginning and then it started to grow from 50 to 60 to 70 to 200.
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah the ones I've been to have had 200 at least!
- **TIMEA**: And you were at the beginning were a participant but not at women time makers but the devfest, right?
- **RAMÓN**: Yeah it's... Your memory is better than mine. So I've been helping out with Women Techmakers now, this 2020 would have been my third year of participating of being in an organization member. Then in 2017 I gave a talk at the Women Techmakers conference about teaching children to code and then before that I was a participant, er, an attendee, sorry.
- **TIMEA**: I actually remember meeting you the first time at devfest where Pilar was coming along, your sister, right?
- **RAMÓN**: That's right.
- **TIMEA**: First pilar got interested in our community I think and then you joined.
- **RAMÓN**: Yes, so my sister Pilar. It's a fun story, because at the time, this was 2014 and Devfest Vienna was taking place, which is the yearly local GDG, or Google Developer Group conference. I had been working in tech for four years or so, and I was still in an even more shy place, and so my  sister who was studying biology at the time said "hey, why don't you just go I'll come with you. I'll have free pizza and whatever, and I'll, you know, check out some of the talks" and she just fell in love with the community. We both did! She liked it so much that she changed her career from microbiology to software engineering, and she's now studying at a university in London. Remotely, of course right now.
- **TIMEA**: So how about we invite her on a chat with us to tell us her story?
- **RAMÓN**: I think she'll be able to tell it so much better than I would.
- **TIMEA**: Yeah let's let's do that I really would like to get Pilar to motivate and inspire us as well.
- **RAMÓN**: Totally, she's doing some fantastic stuff. But I'll let her toot her own horn. So I just had such a good time you know attending and speaking at women techmakers that I think I either wrote to you or to someone else who was organizing I said "Listen, I want to help, you know, I want to keep this going" and it was a great time and-
- **TIMEA**: Look where we are today and with a crazy podcast, yeah.
- **RAMÓN**: It's definitely one of the more out there experiences for me right now! I didn't think... you know, I've got this microphone but I didn't think that I would use it for podcasting I thought i'd be doing it for giving talks
- **TIMEA**: You can do both.
- **RAMÓN**: Absolutely, you never know where it's going to go. But yeah, so the objective of these conferences, right, we wanted to showcase women in STEM who are doing really fascinating things and inspiring, mostly, because our target group was mostly students, right?
- **TIMEA**: Yeah, we started with students and we were mostly located and we're still located at the technical university with our conference so yeah as a side effect it attracts the students there, but I have to admit that because we're already eight years old, we kind of grew with the community and the community with us so I noticed that it turned from students into, you know, people that have already five to ten years experience on the job so I would say now it's more the young professionals and I include students in that as well.
- **RAMÓN**:  yeah absolutely and and that kind of what i like about that what i like about having that opportunity is that we kind of can help folks that are trying to figure out where they want to go in their careers show them what the possibilities are one of the talks that inspired me so much is we had we had a scientist come on i think it was last year the year before who showed us how they were creating uh artificial heart valves do you remember and i was uh
- the tissue engineering t-shirt wasn't it yes that was fascinated everybody at the conference we haven't gotten so many amazing positive feedback replies like we did for for that talk so that was pretty something
- do we have a link to that we could put it in the show notes
-  yeah we ought to have it on our youtube channel we have to look that up
-  exactly i mean on the note of the of the youtube channel what you know as we've been doing this conference for a few years we've been recording these talks and putting them online for for people to watch
-  yes and this that's where our podcast will also be going to it's the same channel basically right so um the aim of the conference was always to showcase female role models uh from stem not just i.t but really different domains and because it's different domains we hadn't had the opportunity to go into in-depth of a particular domain so we always kept it on a generic level of let's get people introduced into tissue engineering into uh you know machine learning at the general um like you know ai ai in journalism we had the topic this year about um interfaces inclusive interfaces so it's like very different we had also two years ago a conference that was more focused on environmental uh engineering and civil engineering together
-  yeah yeah i remember one that had a big focus on sustainable uh civil engineering
-  and a couple of years before we also had one uh focused on startups even we had some really cool talks of female startup founders basically so yeah it's a big topic yes it is and sustainability alike uh so we've been always trying to see what does the community want from our conference and try to deliver that content yeah and also about four years ago we started doing kids workshops in parallel to the main track
- that's that's that was something that that really blew me away when i first attended i thought there's that big problem right for for women working in in the stem fields of how they can take out the conference for context takes place on a saturday so you know that is time normally spent with family and being able to offer this this workshop so that we could so that our our organizers and um and and people giving the workshop could watch watch these children teach them something cool and the kids they do some cool stuff
- oh my god i wanted to be part of this yeah some pictures online on the website
- yeah we'll put that in the show notes too yeah we they they do stuff like um we had one
- toothpaste elephant
- i do not
- they basically posted all the um well it was in a seminar room at the table and they posted the whole room with uh well foil basically to clean it up easy and then in the middle of the room they had this plastic something where they put all these ingredients together and then it started to grow and grow and grow and it grew over and if like spilled over the table this elephant toothpaste i think it was blue or some color wow and it was just so fantastic and the parents were in the door looking up what are they doing we have pictures of that the kids were so excited and they were like oh my god i want to do chemistry in my life and this is so cool and they also did they froze a rose in liquid nitrogen again like everybody wanted to see what's going on and that's right that's get that's what gets you excited about science
- absolutely absolutely yeah i i remember uh helping someone set up a programming for children course that was also pretty fun getting the kids interested in in how computers work and how they could you know how they could look into uh programming as a hobby and or career right yeah and i think i think having that from a young age as well especially having that exposure really helps show folks especially having someone as a from a mentorship someone someone a little more diverse like a woman or uh you know someone who's not a white man you know show them these amazing opportunities i think it really it really helps keep people motivated so to speak
- yes it was always about raising awareness and and giving the opportunity for those that didn't have so far because everything for the conference is for free for us we always believe that education motivation this kind of aspect should be um for free for our members
- and uh so given given let's say that i don't have a lot of experience organizing a conference how does how does getting funding for that work how does how does you know working out deals with let's say a venue a venue for 200 people how would you go about that
- oh this is a big topic how much
- how i opened the can of worms um
- no well in a nutshell we we targeted a very specific talent pool women in stem and that even now this year i've started to realize how valuable that is for for example for companies that are looking to hire women in stem uh so i think you got the hint here our collaboration partners were on one side the companies and on one side the other ngos and also the university so with the university we got last year into the into i'm going to tiara frown uh of the woo program
- that's uh that's german isn't it
- yes it was last year they were celebrating at the technical university 100 years since women went uh to uh to to teach at the university they were allowed to teach finally um and they wanted to do a whole year program around this supporting diversity and gender equality uh ngos and events and that just happened to be also for us um an opportunity uh that we got to be part of the program uh which led to us getting the venue uh under a partnership but you know to get to this level we kind of we before that work with the informatics department we worked with the um entrepreneur like with the innovation center we had a partner and then we and we still collaborate with them uh career center and the gender competence department there yeah so a lot of entities and people that had to come together over years for us to solidify this partnership with the university to be able to get the venuea sponsored yeah
- sounds like it takes a while
- yeah but it doesn't mean that you know with a new ngo you cannot have it faster it definitely can also work out faster but what the point that i wanted to say is that for us the venue was always very important because the value venue sets the atmosphere and the tone and i think like from the beginning i wanted to have an event in coopers also it took me what six years to realize that dream of mine because i always felt like cooper's all if you know this uh huge hall um at the technical university is is mostly all out of wood and it just sets a very i would say comfortable and proper atmosphere um because we have we wanted to create a comfort zone for our participants to be okay to share yeah and unfortunately not just always the positive aspects but also the negative aspects of you know being the single woman on team xyz um and once i i think once we managed to create this comfort zone uh then we managed to migrate the conference into something that is an inclusive welcoming atmosphere that goes beyond gender it should be about diversity end of the day because we believe in women techmakers uh in diversity um and equality regardless of gender right so you know it just takes time that all these things shift and go towards our diversity uh vision it just didn't happen from the get-go like that and it wouldn't have been possible without the community sort of reflecting or telling us in which direction to go yeah
- absolutely you need to have that that open communication channel and a lot of work a lot of a lot of patience and uh correct me if i'm wrong but but women techmakers is a is purely run by volunteers that's right is that right
- yep none of us are paid by google or by women tech makers to do this we only as you know do it um on the side of our full-time jobs or part-time jobs weekends evenings yeah and it's a lot of passion
- absolutely out of passion and i mean people people like you and i we have the privilege to be able to have the resources to be able to dedicate this time to it so if if we can why not right yeah yeah it's and it's and it's a lot of work to be able to pull something like this off and of course not everything goes perfectly smoothly we have our bumps you know i remember i don't know if i've mentioned this to you i'm going to mention this to you on a recording for the first time the first year that i organized uh that i helped organized women techmakers vienna i was in charge in the eve in the aft in the afternoon half i was in charge of recording the speakers right okay and i was you know i was it was a camera on a stand you know i had to stand up on a on a box and make sure that the camera was pointing
- we have a picture of you doing this
- oh no and and at some point i don't remember who was speaking but there was a there was a speaker who liked to who when speaking moved around a lot like walked around like some speakers tend to wander around the stage and i don't know what happened but my brain just shut off for a while i was just focusing on the on the speaker and the talk like not looking at the camera but looking past the camera at the stage and i look at the camera and the speakers nowhere to be found on the camera i'm like oh my god i lost the speaker on the camera so there's like at least i i don't know maybe two maybe five hopefully maximum five minutes of footage of the just the wall anyhow i mean the point is it happens you know you're you're doing your best you learn from your mistakes and you know i think i think what makes a good i think what makes a an organization and and a a a conference like this successful is the fact that you are receptive to that feedback because i i've seen in my years of attending so as a so i for context i'm a software engineer i spend a lot of my time going to software engineering conferences and i find a lot of the i find there are more than i would like to say that there are a few events that you know receive this feedback and then don't respond well to it dig their heels in so to speak and i think what makes something successful is when somebody comes to us say for women took makers and say oh i'm really i'm so bored of of you all serving those uh bagels for lunch every year can we get something else to listen to them and say okay this works this doesn't how can we make a a response that's uh satisfactory and also you know internalize that feedback and sort of grow from it you know what i mean and yeah
- it's not easy to be honest yeah and we also had to learn to do that actually so but yeah at the same time i have to also say that lately i'm i'm yearning for feedback from the community actually more than uh yeah it shifts
- absolutely absolutely i mean this year for the first because of because of the need to be remote we tried our hand at something completely new which was the women techmakers online conference and uh that was completely new for us we tried a bunch of new things some worked some we still need to figure out um we could probably dedicate some uh an episode of this podcast totalk about online conferences that's something near and dear to my
heart um
- by meanwhile read the blog post that ramon wrote about the whole experience of moving a on on offline conference to an online let's put that in the show notes
i guess i'll have to remember to to promote myself in the show notes
- that's what i'm here for
- yeah we gotta do this for each other um
yeah and and so yeah learning yearning for more feedback and yeah just just you
know hopefully seeing what works seeing what doesn't work and being receptive
to it and it's important absolutely speaking of importance another thing that i
find that that really correct me if i'm wrong i'm curious to hear so for
conferences for me having as a speaker having a code of conduct is absolutely
essential to me right if i if i get invited to or apply to speak at a
conference i notice that i that they don't have a code of conduct i'll find hmm
i should really ask them why they don't have a code of conduct there's a blog
post by ash dryden that i will post in the show notes about why it's important
to have a code of conduct for you as a speaker as an attendee and even as an
organizer to feel safe but that's enough of my monologue i'm curious timia how
how how what's the history of women techmakers and the code of conduct if
that's not putting you on the spot
- then i don't know yeah um
we've we've been working on it several times so i think this is like the third
fourth iteration that we have on our website the last time actually pilar um i
think worked on it maybe together with you
- is it uh i i think two years ago i
adapted the berlin code of conduct yeah that's the one i have yes so um i i
can't say that i personally was much involved in the topic um but you and pilar
had a very good point especially from your experiences from other conferences
that this is something that should be very important and not taken for granted
so i remember as the fact that yes we changed it we improved it and then we had
a dedicated space always in the beginning of the conference and also on our
chat platforms to flash that there's a code of contact contact if something is
going wrong then you can um talk to xyz at the conference so i think in the
past two years that became for us uh must uh part of the best practice because
you know we want to build an inclusive conference and atmosphere where
everybody's safe and i think that's just one big step that needs to happen for
us to be taken seriously
- absolutely i think i think i think the
the big sticking point of code of conduct is that of enforceability right
because one thing is to just have a copy-paste code of conduct and say we're
done here and then when an incident actually happens you can't you don't know
how to act on it so because it's not set in crystal terms what happens if a
code of conduct breach happens it takes place so it i i've met a lot of folks
uh in my journey who or a few conferences that say something like but we're all
adults we don't need a code of conduct it'll be fine we'll figure it out and a
lot of the times those are the events and those are the people to whom with
whom these let's say discrep these transgressions take place you know
- beyond conferences i
think this is necessary in companies as well and some of the companies have it
and it's called you know anti-harassment for example or whatever you want to
call it as a policy um and it shouldn't be taken lightly because you have to
have a guideline of what how should i act if something happens and you have to
have like if you have a code of contact you have a very good argument to um
showcase that there was a wrongdoing that's all what i want to say about that
yeah
- no i thank you though i think i think i
know that i know that in the past i've as as you hinted earlier i've kind of me
and my my sister we've kind of been the sticklers that are coming constantly
code of conducting uh and then trying to you know and push that to be enforced
further i think i think what we've done now is get us to a point as well
something i'd like to touch on is um to whom it applies because what i find
interesting about a code of conduct is also that you know it an uh an attendee
needs to abide by the code of conduct a speaker needs to abide by the code of
conduct it's a little more involved because they also need to make sure that
with their speed with their with their talk with their slides they don't break
the code of cognitive but as organizers we need to abide by the code of
contract as well as humans we can mess up and so what one thing for example if
i may uh uh if i may um ruminate about here is i'm wondering what can we do to
enforce a cloud of to have a team of folks enforce the code of conduct
separated separatedly from the organizing team do you know what i mean
- yeah
it's something like you don't see the forest because of the trees kind of as an
organizer maybe if as an organizer you could also break the code of conduct and
then how do you enforce a code of conduct on yourself how do how do your fellow
attendees enforce a code of conduct on you without breaking some sort of
hierarchy that may or may not exist inside that organization team because for
example maybe one thing we could go into in a bit is that women techmakers on a
yearly basis for the last i'm not sure how many years you're going to correct
me in a moment has had rotating lead organizers right so what happens if that
lead organizer breaks the code of conduct that's where the argument comes in
for having a team separate from the organizing team called the code of conduct
enforcement team or code of conduct team without making it sound too
- i see what you mean
- yeah
have you have you had any experience with that
- i can relate to it but i haven't had
experience with it for me it's always like you okay i've been there for women
time makers constantly for the last eight years and yes the every year the main
organizer changes but it has to do a lot with my how i approach people like i i
want to say that i always trust people and put always the good first and i'm
sometimes in the wrong but i expect my fellow organizer or organizers to make
me aware if i'm doing something wrong or if somebody else is doing something
wrong so that's why we are so many i mean we are many and we can do that i've
never had the problem that we never had actually the problem to that extent
that somebody didn't i mean do something wrong yeah and i mean if that's the
point then i think you would as an organizer immediately not feel good in the
team anymore because then we that means that we don't share the same values
- uh oh right yeah you mean that yeah
- so it's sort of like
yeah i think did you have any experience um i i i i guess sorry i'm sorry to
put you on the spot just discussing here it's fine yeah um no i mean i've been
you know as as it may become clear if we do more of it if we do end up turning
it this into a long-running podcast i go to a lot of conferences and i really
like them so i i'm always looking into how other teams are organizing theirs i
i find it interesting to to to see how these people try to create uh an
inclusive safe environment so that people can thrive connect communicate and
and grow it grow in their careers grow as people so have i have i seen inc have
i you know been witness to conferences that have had incidents yes of course i
mean these things happen especially behind the scenes a lot more than we take
than we take for granted um and i think it's i think it's i find it interesting
to think how can we that's why that's why i find myself a lot of the time
thinking how can we prevent uh incidents like these from taking place
especially from an organizational standpoint and i think i think you put it
quite well to email when you said you know that this person a person who's in
an organizational team who witnesses something that they don't like they if if
if they don't speak up if anything it says more about the the structure itself
of the team that's not working which fortunately i don't i think i think i can
confidently say we haven't had yet in women tech makers yeah
- if i have a
team member that doesn't speak up that i'm failing absolutely with what we're
doing here like it's that i would see as a fail yeah in the first place and
likely i'm hoping that we didn't have that yeah
- yeah hopefully um so but but let's
let's go into that because i think so there's a few conferences i go to that do
have rotating teams for example there's the european ruby conference that what
they do every year is it takes place in a different uh city in europe and also
headed up by a completely different team so like nobody who organized last
year's euroco in uh in and um in the netherlands will be organizing the one
that takes place next year in helsinki okay so i'm i'm curious what was what
was the impetus for trying this with women techmakers by having a lead
organizer be different every year
- well it wasn't necessarily the plan that
it's every year different it's just quite some work yeah and after organizing
it for a year you want you want a break sure that's one aspect and the second
aspect is it's just natural because you want to develop yourself so i already
did this i learned a lot what's next yeah like what can i do next to grow and
that can be that you take again a different role potentially on on different
tasks and you learn there something or yeah it also happens that we have
members that left to join other organizations or just focus on their careers
that's also absolutely fine so the whole rotating is it just it kind of it just
kind of happened like that and at the same time it leaves a space for someone
else to grow in this role i can't say that everybody who was in a main
organizer position had all the skills and know-how from the get-go but there
was opportunity to grow into this and to learn from it um so it's natural and
that's one aspect but the rest of the team uh i'm happy to say that we have
kind of a core team that kind of is the same every year and that gives you
extra support because you know the people already that you're gonna be working
with there are friendships that are created internally so there's a support
system that's awesome however i can't say that it's perfect because um to be
super honest here we also had the case where the main organizer after the
conferences were almost burned out or actually burned out because it's it's you
know full-time job you do this on the side main organizer means more or less
being a project manager for a huge conference huge 200 100 200 people which is
not little
- it's pretty big
- you have a team
of six seven people uh different tasks that you have to juggle and manage and
then i think that the month right before the conference is super intense yeah
uh and i can't say that it's perfect in how we organize ourselves because it
was um always the feedback sometimes the feedback that after the confidence
there's like like a burnout of the main organizer and that's something that i
wanted to overcome and we for that reason we had last year the conference where
we had two main organizers um it kind of worked and it actually it actually
more worked than it didn't and we definitely didn't have this feedback of it
was too much for one person
- that's good
- um this year he was just one
make an organizer but the problem was not the conference was the fact that we
had to cancel it one week before everything was set up and we were like let's
go and then the log down happened and then we had to like shift it and sometime
in june we got back on track and was like okay let's do it online so that was
that was a different disappointment for the main organizer yeah however the
details i would actually like to discuss with the actual main organizers
themselves because we want to invite them on the podcast
- absolutely i think i think giving them
giving them the the space to talk about what their experiences are what they
learned and
- yeah the good and the bad
- the good and the bad yeah warts and all as they say
on that note timia for you because you've been doing this for a while could you
you know enumerate these these sex these success these successes that you've
had
- oh well i i think i want to
categorize this into personal successes and community successes so first of all
i already mentioned that one big goal of mine and dream was that we have the
conference in the coopers al that was that was a big success for me um i never
thought that i could see in a volunteer organization so much dedication that
transforms in a sustainable team that stays the same over years that for me is
the is is a huge feedback positive uh feedback yeah that the people just want
to stick around yeah so that's for me personally also beyond my expectation
- yeah it's been a while yes
- you know you're also in here for what
three years now so yeah do you know why you stick around but obviously there's
something
- i'm not going anywhere anytime soon
- awesome
um and that's we managed to grow organically to 200 attendees at the conference
which is what we had last year the last face-to-face conference plus the
enormous positive feedback from the community that we actually managed to
create an inclusive environment welcoming that's also something that we that
happened organically for it's not i can't really say or i don't even have
particular pawn points to say okay we did this on purpose to become inclusive
it's something that comes from the community as feedback after each conference
so it's a bit of a personal goals mixed with community goals
- which i think are fantastic motivators
honestly okay and um
- and there's more also
a big success that i i would call a big success is the fact that um we don't
need to actively go and how i call fundraise or find partnerships for the
conference they knock at our door and that for me is again you know we managed
to establish ourselves what we stand for and the companies or the partners
already know about us and want to partner with us because we are known for
quality or for um providing specific tailored yeah to their needs solutions to
their needs that's also very relieving however covid happened so i think i
think everything is about to change
- fingers crossed we can keep doing a a
good job at providing these platforms for people
- yes uh but after eight years i and and the kovi situation happening i
think we need to get out of the comfort zone again yet again and reinvent
ourselves with the i i don't think that for example so we we know for sure that
the conference as it happened last year we cannot provide that next year it's
very unlikely that we can have a face-to-face conference just too much
uncertainty so we either do it online uh learning from this year or we simply
reinvent ourselves such as the podcast whatever else our organizers and
community members want they should just email us because we can make it happen
- absolutely
- not not everything in the
whole world but you know we can discuss it
- so what you're saying is the the
milkshake bar at the conference is probably not going to happen anytime soon
- never say wish for it but never say
never
- cool um awesome
awesome i you know i i i just really it's been such an honor to be on this this
organizing team because i think like you said it's been we've been at this for
a while you see there there's there's a bit of a there's a there's after a
while we've kind of built up the sense of camaraderie that spills over when new
people join in or when people have to leave because they want to pursue
different efforts or they have to move to another city i feel like that sense
of sticking together really means a lot to me because i think it i think it
spills out into the conference as well yeah and and like you said i'm i'm kind
of really liking your your emphasis on jumping out of the comfort zone i think
i think by by fostering this and and by keeping going you know something that a
personal objective of mine with the women techmakers online conference was to
establish some sort of online community that we could then push forwards and
foster it's been a bit dormant lately uh i'll admit probably uh partly on me we
we started up a discord community um where people can chat and attend we we
used it during the conference to sort of attend the conference where people
could chat and ask questions we found out some things along the way uh i'm just
going to quickly drop this because i loved it so we had a voice if you're
unfamiliar with discord discord is a kind of an online hangout community uh
chat platform also voice platform initially used for games but now it's also
has a bigger online community uh uh emphasis and so tamiya had this idea that
we do an online breakfast at the beginning of the second we split it into two
days
- i think it wasn't my idea
- it wasn't your
idea well you did have an idea that i want to that i that i wanted
- was magic's idea
- what was my sorry
my bad but we had this we had this this voice channel where we had a breakfast
and then you had the idea where you um just went into that voice channel we
renamed it to voice hangout and you just hung out there and attendees would
drop in every now and then do you remember yeah
- we called it lunch the lounge
- that's
the lounge love it and i i was so blown away by this because hey i'd never seen
it before at an online conference and b it would have never occurred to me in a
million years that people would want to voice chat during talks i thought that
was incredible and i think that's where i think this whole emphasis on stepping
out of your comfort zone goes really well because you don't know what's going
to come from it right
- yeah unless you try it
- unless you try it i kind of
i kind of like that unless you try it like go for it
- this year was also for me personally a
lot of going out of the comfort zone so i'm trying to almost get comfortable
with being out of the comfort zone
- i like that
- you could say that and um
i think it's at the same time a good opportunity to tackle new topics to try
new things also for women tech makers vienna
- awesome cool
well you know we've been chatting here for a bit yeah i think we could start
winding down i think we've during
- my last zips of the
coffee
