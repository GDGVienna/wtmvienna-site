    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>Women Techmakers Vienna is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of developers in any form.</p>
<p>
This code of conduct applies to all Women Techmakers Vienna spaces, including but not limited to our Conferences and Webinars, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from attending at the discretion of the RESPONSE TEAM.</p>
<ul>Harassment includes:
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions such as “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
<li>Threats of violence.</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
<li>Stalking or following.</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
<li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
<li>Women Techmakers Vienna prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. RESPONSE TEAM reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding the following: “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism” and “reverse sexism”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If you are being harassed by a member of the Women Techmakers Vienna community or attendee of one of the Women Techmakers Vienna events, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the RESPONSE TEAM immediately. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>
<p>In order to protect attendees and members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>
<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Women Techmakers members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
<p>You can report violations in the following ways:</p>
<p>Email Julia Undeutsch <a href="mailto:yuridevat@gmail.com">yuridevat@gmail.com</a></p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Developers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, RESPONSE TEAM may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Women Techmakers Vienna events and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Women Techmakers members or the general public.</p>
