  title: "code! - draw! - stitch!"
  place: "Room 2"
  description: "Turtlestitch is based on a modified Snap!, a web-based graphic programming tool similar to Scratch. The modification enables to use the pen tool to generate patterns that can be read by embroidery machines. Thus it brings together the abstract logic of programming with the material logic of textiles.<br>During the workshop, the participants will be instructed to design a pattern and how to materialize this pattern as embroidery on a textile. You can bring your own T-shirts (at your own risk) or use textiles provided."

  title: "Building bridges: Neuro-inspired technologies"
  place: "Room 1"
  description: "500 million years of evolution produced performant, ultra-light, energy-effective biological neuronal networks. Insects and worms only possess a few hundred neurons, but they are able to navigate, make decisions, adapt their behavior and communicate. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that small rodents’ brains are relying on meta-cognition for optimal learning. Through examples, I will explore how neuroscience can profoundly inspire both conceptual and hardware changes in technological innovation."

  title: "Using the Power of Machines – Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"
  place: "Room 2"
  description: "Artificial Intelligence is being talked about all over these days. In this talk you will get an introductory overview of what Machine Learning is and how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to a variety of applications. Of course, we will also look at some real examples where you can see how classical machine learning or deep learning has been used to help organizations gain better insights and take more informed actions."

  place: "Room 1"
  description: "Be it mammoth hunters during the ice age, or Open Source-developers in 2018: Each group develops unique traditions, which can make it difficult to break up stereotypes and have newcomers feel welcome. I’ll talk about how you can identify these cultural, non-technical aspects in a community and share my experience of what worked (and what didn’t) when trying to encourage a higher rate of women* and newcomers in tech-events."

  title: "Artificial Tissue for implants"
  place: "Room 1"
  description: "The generation of artificial tissue for implants and bypass grafting has long been the focus of scientific research. One of the biggest challenges has been to create multi-layer tissue structures designed to enable the diffusion of nutrients for surrounding cells in a similar manner to natural tissue. I have successfully constructed a blood vessel wall in a Petri dish, using the resident cells of an artery. This engineered vessel wall behaves very similarly to the blood vessel wall in the human body, both in its structure and its function."

  place: "Room 1"
  description: "'How come we can only define a method once?' Ever taught kids to code? They have this magical ability to take something you think you understand well and turn it upside down within an instant. They challenge norms and ask questions that you never thought could be asked. Challenges aside, teaching has been an extraordinary turning point for me. I highly recommend it! You can take the lessons learned from doing so and turn them into valuable skills. These can help you become an active member of the developer community. Everyone can benefit from teaching, and not just from teaching kids!"
