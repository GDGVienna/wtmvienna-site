  description: "Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer, wrote in her celebrated book <i>Lean In</i> that we women often sabotage our career “by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands and by pulling back when we should be leaning in”. Of course, women can be held back also by many other hurdles, however this one sentence highlights the obstacles that women tend to create within themselves."

  title: "Effective communication in IT projects as a success factor - why women are the perfect match"
  place: "Room 1"
  description: "Usually IT specialists with extended technical knowledge evolve to become project managers. One explanation is that having profound knowledge in IT domain is considered as essential prerequisite to become an IT project manager. Looking at the gender distribution in IT it is very clear that women are currently underrepresented. What my work experience has taught me is that it is possible to manage IT projects without having detailed technical know-how but being a good communicator and enabler for a great team of specialists you can rely on instead. This talk will highlight what is needed to communicate effectively in project management and that women carry a lot of the needed skills in them."

  place: "Room 1"
  description: "Ever wondered why we are here? What are the social, cultural or personal factors that bring women to the tech field? As a sociologist with training, Nino tried to explore existing international research findings, as well as, to conduct her own survey to define current context in Georgia.<br>During this talk you will hear interesting stories, find out about striking commonalities and share your thoughts with each other. Session will summarize explicit or latent influences that affect decisions of young girls and women, from childhood throughout their career. You'll realize how much parents, teachers, early access to computers, cultural stereotypes of even content of school textbooks matter in this process. We hope after the session you will learn how we as speakers, mentors, sisters or acquaintances can do our part to enhance positive facilitating factors and avoid negative preconceptions.<br>We invite you to share, discuss and refine practical steps for direct application in our environment to support women participation and a true empowerment. It's never late to start programming and it's never late to support others in this path."
