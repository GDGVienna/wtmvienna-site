  title: "The Voice of Diversity - the Key Success Factor of the Modern Working World?"
  place: "Workshop Room"
  description: "Diversity - Equality - Inclusion: Diversity in the workplace is more than raising the women´s quota or having employees of different backgrounds. Inclusion has to the be the goal in order to fully grasp the strengths and knowledge that each individual employee has. Do you agree and what does this mean for you specifically? Let´s develop a roadmap for a successful Diversity Management Strategy for a modern working world together! Initially we will give an introduction into the topic (definition, status quo, figures, best practice examples etc.) and then we will work with the participants on the topic, exchange and discuss ideas and experiences and develop possible strategies!"

  title: "Career Transition: Find Your Fit and Make the Move"
  place: "Domed Hall"
  description: "Career transition is more common in tech than we think and without a practical goal and a strategic plan in place, it can be an overwhelming experience for many. Some people may think about switching domains forever but the will never make the move due to the fear of failure. That can eventually lead to a mediocre career where verticle or horizontal growth becomes stagnant. While transitioning requires self-discipline and planning but in order to do this effectively and successfully, the power of a supportive professional network, mentoring and sponsorship cannot be undermined. This talk takes a practical approach towards successfully achieving that goal."

  title: "Creating more Inclusive Products and Services"
  place: "Domed Hall"
  description: "We often generate and evaluate product ideas based on what we know, and, in consequence, based on our biases. But every design decision we make can raise or lower barriers to participation in society. If we use our own biases as a starting point, we end up with products designed for people of a certain age, gender, language and physical ability. Inclusive design is a method of designing products, services and experiences that draws on the full spectrum of human diversity."

  title: "How We can control Computers with our Thoughts using Brain-Computer Interfacing"
  place: "Domed Hall"
  description: "Mind control seems like a far-fetched idea from science fiction films, but what many people don't realize is that we already possess the technology to control computers with only our thoughts. The field of Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is creating some very exciting possibilities, especially for people who are physically disabled and unable to move and/or communicate. This talk will give you an introduction to the basic concepts of BCI and how our team at the University of Vienna is applying brain wave analysis and machine learning in order for paralyzed patients to control a computer game with only their thoughts."

  title: "Non-Code Contribution to Open Source: My Story of Imposter Syndrome, Personal Growth and Open Minds."
  place: "Domed Hall"
  description: "A healthy open source community needs developers and non-developers alike. Really? What is non-code contribution and why should someone want to do that? My personal story will show what got me into devoting my spare time to open source projects, why open source communities are always looking for help and what you could help with if you’re not a programmer (yet) - ie. what is non-code contribution. Last but not least I will explain & show what one can gain from contributing to open source projects and how this empowers us. I plan to shortly introduce what open source is and give some examples of os-projects & why I think that 'open' concepts that derived from the open source idea (like open knowledge, open science, open data, open source tomato seeds and many more) give answers to some big sociopolitical challenges of our time. But the focus of my talk shall be put on my personal experiences with open source and open source communities (like Drupal). Hereby I will show how welcoming and respectful os communities are to newbies. I will share insights I gained, things I learnt and how the community encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone but also provided a safety net. How I could try and learn new things, personally grow and meet interesting people. I will show how my engagement in os until today helps me beat impostor syndrome, how my mindset and leadership style changed and why I created Open Minds, the Austrian Open Source Award. I will explain how all of this led to a new job and resulted in a happy life with a healthy work life balance, enough family time with the baby and a highly appreciated career path where I can learn and grow and am able to try something new and experiment (with the backup of an amazing team ;). What you will learn: 1. what is open source, the open source mindset & values 2. hands-on examples of what you could contribute (non-code) 3. your benefits of getting involved (personal & professional/career) 4. how to find and approach an interesting community"

  title: "Co-Create the Future of Your Profession"
  place: "Domed Hall"
  description: "How an agile mindset empowered me to found a rising UX team. Pushing a new field or profession in the company can be quite tough and sometimes also taxing. Especially as a woman it's sometimes even harder as we might be afraid of taking over a lot of new responsibilities or 'stabbing into a bee's nest'. As UX Designer in a software development company it's sometimes easier to introduce UX at clients than developing this field further in your own company. That is why I want so share some lessons I learned during my journey, which started as a lone UX designer and brought me to lay the foundation for a rising team. An essential component of my path was to overcome the feeling that I'm not prepared for the upcoming challenges and to find a way to convince my colleagues and leaders to trust in me and my plans. People who attend my talk will learn how an agile mindset can help to revolutionize a discipline in the own company, what obstacles may come up and possible ways to tackle them. Everyone shall leave inspired and ready to drive their personal topics forward in their companies."
